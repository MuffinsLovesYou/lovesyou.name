    <p>My personal site for playing around with code. </p>
    <p>I'm currently doing a lot of rewriting and tinkering. The theme I used when initially 
        creating the site had a lot of extra stuff I wasn't interested in.  I stripped away 
        a lot of the stuff I wasn't using and just created my own theme.  The site is super-basic 
        and all I really need is the css and .js to handle element stylings and the 
        tiles I use for hyperlinks.  
    </p>
    <p>I also started working at a place that makes heavy use of backbone.js paired with marionette.js 
        for building their site. Again, there is just a ton of things in there that I'm not interested 
        in for my personal stuff, but I did want to play around with that model of loading pages so I'm 
        writing my own templating scripts inspired by backbone/marionette. Right now I have a routing 
        page that allows for url-hash routing and navigation and a templating object for dynamically 
        loading html or other content types via xhr and will soon have some databinding added in.
