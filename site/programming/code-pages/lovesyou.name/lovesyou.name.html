    <p>I had a strong desire to reinvent some wheels, so I rewrote my site as a custom single page mvvm thing. 
        The main components of this are a router, for handling hash-based pseudo-redirects, and a template structure 
        that allows for loading of content and binding of data. </p>
    <p>It's inspired primarily by (rips off) Backbone.js with the Marionette.js extension, which I've been using at 
        work. But in the end it is so  bare-bones, there isn't too much comparison to make. It fits in the palm of 
        your hand without minification, but is also pretty lean on features since I really just add features as I need them.
