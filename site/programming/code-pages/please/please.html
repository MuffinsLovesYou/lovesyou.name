    <p>This is some code used by this site.</p>
    <p>I don't really care for native Promises syntax. It isn't horrible, and it's better than 
        jQuery's version, but it just feels a bit clunky.</p>

    <p>I wrote this as a sort of syntax-sugar for promise handling. It uses a chained-functional 
        syntax where each chained command builds the object. 
        As an example, if I build two XHR requests: XHR1 and XHR2, and I want them both to complete 
        before performing a function named callback, it would look like this: <br>
        please.do(XHR1)<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.and(XHR2)<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.then((xhr1, xhr2)=>{<br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;callback(); <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});<br>
        Where the parameters xhr1 and xhr2 are the results of the two completed XHR requests. The .and 
        requests can be chained indefinitely, I tested it with a 10k loop of loading a file with new 
        xhr instances. .then still returns a instance of please, so you could continue chaining after that, 
        though I haven't tested that very robustly.</p>
    <p>It's pretty low on features, mostly because I needed it to do this one thing and it does that one 
        thing very well. If I wanted to try and get others to use it, it would need error/fail handling 
        and a lot more testing.
