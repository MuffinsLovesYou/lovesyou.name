								<p>Ok, step one of this project wast getting the foundation working.  Step two is refactor then expand. 
									Last page I posted was the split off 'actions' code.  Here's the calling 'ui' script 
									and the back end module.  I moved the help message and parameter parsing to the calling script since 
									that is more of a ui thing.  That, combined with the breaking off of the actions script freed up a lot 
									of space in the module. That's good because the module is going to get expanded on quite a bit.</p>  
									<p>This update has the addition of the get_missing_item function, which checks all my dwarves to see if they are wearing a 
									particular article of clothing and returns how many dwarves are missing that article.  This is useful for 
									knowing what I have to weave to keep them all clothed, and will eventually contribute to an automated weaving
									system that always maintains a nice 10 piece buffer of clothing pieces.</p>
									<p>This update came with a lot of difficulties as some of what I was doing was not easily supported by the API
										 and had to be hacked around pretty heavily.  I also had to familiarize myself with the C++ project that hosts 
										 the Lua API, which is equal parts impressive and messy (31 contributors over 8-9 years, go figure).
