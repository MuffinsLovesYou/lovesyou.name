<div id='code-page-character-notes'>
    <p>Another piece of code used by this site. At the start of 2017 I started working at a place 
        that used a single-page application based on Marionette.js (a backbone extension) so I 
        wrote the first version of this to get comfortable with the style.  
    </p>
    <p>
        This year, I rewrote it to trim it down a bit, fix some bugs, and change some of its underlying 
        assumptions. Its general flow is to bind content to a container, and bind data to the content. 
        The container is a HTML element. The content can be a url that gets loaded via XHR, or 
        a hard-coded string. The data can likewise be loaded from a url or coded in. The whole thing 
        is kept very simple so that the developer using it has the freedom to extend or modify it at 
        will.
