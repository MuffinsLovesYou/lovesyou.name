<div id='code-page-dice-roller-notes'>
    <p>One of my first programs was an equation-based dice roller written in Objective-C. Every other year 
        I like to revisit the program to either rewrite or refactor it. Two years ago (~2016) I rewrote it 
        to use a sort of dependency injection model, where the main dice roller is a structure that takes 
        applies a series of operations to an input, and where the operations are added in rather than 
        being hard coded in.  
    </p>
    <p>This year (4/18), I kept that base design. Instead of a rewrite, I tried to refactor it for clarity 
        since it tends to be a bit arcane, and to add some unit and integration tests to help with its 
        stability.

    <h2>main roller and operation object </h2>
    <p>The main roller has a operations collection that can be used to modify its behavior by passing in 
        new operations. It has one baked-in operation, which is to roll dice when provided input in the 
        form of '2d6' where the 2 is the number of rolls and the 6 is the facets of the die. 
        The Operation object shows the nuts and bolts. Each Operation can search an input string to see 
        if it is an appropriate target, it can parse an identified substring of the input to retrieve 
        operators and operands, and it can call its function with those as parameters to update the 
        original input.

    <h2>math extensions</h2>
    <p>The math extensions are a set of operations that provide basic PEMDAS functionality to the roller. 
        With them added in, if an equation comes in like : 3*(2+4/2) it will be able to handle the math 
        in the correct order of operations.
