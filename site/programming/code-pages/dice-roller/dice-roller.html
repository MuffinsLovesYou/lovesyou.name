        <p>One of my first programs was an equation-based dice roller written in Objective-C. I use it a lot when 
            playing D&D since that game is very dice-roll intensive. Every other year I like to revisit the 
            program to either rewrite or refactor it.

        <h2>main roller and operation object </h2>
        <p>The main roller is a collection of operations. When it solves for an input, it passes the input 
            to each of the operations in order. Each operation can .search() the input to see if some or 
            all of it is a valid target for that operation. Optionally it can .parse() out meaningful values. 
            Finally it can execute its .call() function, which will replace the part of the input it is targeting 
            with a resolved value.     
        </p>
        <p>For example, if the input is 4+6/3 and the math operations are in place. The divide operation will 
            identify '6/3' as a valid target. It will resolve it to 2, and modify the input to be 4+2. Then the 
            addition operation will identify 4+2, resolve it to 6, and modify the input to 6, completing the solution.

        <h2>math extensions</h2>
        <p>The math extensions are a set of operations that provide basic PEMDAS functionality to the roller. 
            With them added in, if an equation comes in like : 3*(2+4/2) it will be able to handle the math 
            in the correct order of operations.
