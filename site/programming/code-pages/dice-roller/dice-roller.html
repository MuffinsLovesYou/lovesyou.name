    <p>
        This is looking to be the first bit of non-work code I write with the intention of sharing with others. It is almost at 1.0.0
        release stage. This last update was a bit of re-organization, and the addition of 'help' and 'examples' commands
        for documentation.
        <br> Checklist for release is:
        <ul>
            <li>Finalize the base program</li>
            <li>Do formal testing</li>
            <li>Bring someone in for usability testing</li>
            <li>Create a repository with some documentation</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        After release I will probably have some features and modules to add. One module I want for is to extend the base roller to
        handle full PEMDAS order of operations just to test and demonstrate the extensibility of the program. After that,
        some additional key words that change the way the data is output to the user would be in order.
