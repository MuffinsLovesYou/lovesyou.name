        This code solves this <a href='http://entibo.fr/lvlr' target='_blank'>puzzle prototype</a>. The guy who runs that
        site was asking for help in an algorithms discussion board, and the problem got picked up by a programming-challenges
        board where I found it. As of this writing, this solution is the only non-brute-force approach, using a deductive
        methodology to solve the problems.
