    <p>After getting the first draft of the textiles script set up and working, I wanted to refactor before expanding into new
        functionality. First part of the refactor was splitting the 'actions' functionality into its own utility module,
        seen below. It still needs some formal testing and to be run through a linter, but already it feels a lot cleaner
        for being decoupled from the textiles functionality. </p>
