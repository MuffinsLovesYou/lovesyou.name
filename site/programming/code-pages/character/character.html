<div id='code-page-character-notes'>
    <p>I've been having a lot of fun rewriting my site, including my D&D tools. The site is now 
        a sordid single-page mvvm affair. The viewmodel loads its .html, and then gets passed 
        the data to bind to it from the character-specific calling page.</p>
    <p>The model has gotten cleaned up a bit too.  I stripped all the .html and images out of 
        my D&D library so that it is just scripts. This also let me split off skills, and soon, 
        classes into their own files so that things are more well defined. </p>

    <p>You should be able to see all this in action with one of the 
        character sheets at <a href='#character-sheets' target='_blank'>#character-sheets</a>. 
    </p>
