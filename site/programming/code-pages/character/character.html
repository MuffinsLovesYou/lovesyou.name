<div id='code-page-character-notes'>
    <p>This is part of last-week's project. I started just updating my dice roller, but then I realized it had been over a year
        since I had done any significant work on my D&D stuff. Likewise, it had some known issues when trying to port it
        to the website (race conditions with script loading that didn't occur when it was just a filesystem app). <br> The
        D&D project is the very definition of a small personal project that has outgrown its scope several times. It started
        as ad-hoc html pages with all the data hard-coded into them. Basically I was using HTML as a text editor since I
        could have more full control over the formatting. Then I started having just one single markup page, and the content
        was stored in .js files and passed to it. The last revision a year ago was bringing in require.js to manage my script
        loading so that I could start building an actual D&D library of scripts to support an object-oriented approach.
        <br> So this last revision. I finally created a proper character object/model (the first script below) and a another
        (second below) that pushes it to the waiting html page. There were quite a few other changes as well:
        <ul>
            <li>Anonymized all page-load functions sinced they wouldn't need to be called but once</li>
            <li>Made sure everything was scoped in an appropriate object to unclutter the global space</li>
            <li>Renamed and reorganized files</li>
            <li>Revisited how I utilized require.js for loading and fixed all race conditions.</li>
            <li>Imported and tailored json and xml databases for items and spells</li>
        </ul>
