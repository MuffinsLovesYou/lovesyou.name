# The hive 
The hive is between one and two hundred miles south of Furnace. Pashu's people can get you most of the way by griffon flight. The region is a sparsely populated savanna mostly known for trade routes passing through it. 

The hive can be viewed from a rocky hill about a half mile away. It looks like a series of irregular mounds. Given the distance, they are likely as tall as multi-story buildings. 



Hivers: 

[Grue](#monsterbox/Star Spawn Grue)
These bizarre creatures scurry about endlessly and seem to be the workers of the hive. They look sort of like little crabs, crawling on six articulated legs. Instead of claws though, they have small three-fingered hands, and instead of a shell, they have what looks like a grinning face with no lips or eyelids. They chitter and periodically shriek at one another. You find yourself experiencing mild hallucinations when around them too long. 

[Mangler](#monsterbox/Star Spawn Mangler)
This creature has dark hairy spider-like legs attached to a multi-segmented body. It moves erratically, with the segments and legs bending and contorting in irregular patterns so that when taking a step, a leg may pass under or over the body. It's skin shimmers when moving, and settles into a natural camouflage when at rest. 

[Hulk](#monsterbox/Star Spawn Hulk)


[Seer](#monsterbox/Star Spawn Seer)
1x [Larva_Mage](#monsterbox/Star Spawn Elder Mage)
