# Jangalee Pashu  
Jangalee Pashu is one of the merchant lords. He specializes in the trade of magical creatures. His services include the direct trade of such creatures, the harvest of exotic materials and components, and mercenary services. His mercenary services are noteworthy for his ability to deploy his monstrosities, though he also maintains a considerable conventional force. 

Pashu is most notable for his flotilla, a small fleet of galley ships that serve as a mobile base of operations for him around the East Sea. His flagship, the Tiger's Eye is outfitted primarily as luxury accomodations, and he often favors entertaining clients there rather than on shore. Aside from several other core ships that serve various utility roles, the flotilla varies in size depending on its cargo as different vessels are outfitted to specialize in transporting different types of creatures. Aside from the flotilla, he maintains bases in other ports. Some bases are intended for containment and preservation of high-value creatures. Others exist to defend strategic resources or to serve as supply and information hubs for his group. 

He has a reasonable mercenary force on retainer. Many serve in mundane roles with basic combat training and otherwise can multi-purpose as sailors or laborers. There are quite a few specialists though with expertise in tracking and capturing the sort of creatures that the business is based on. 


## Merchant Lords
The merchant lords are an alliance of powerful merchants who dominate international trade. The alliance allows them to limit conflicts arising from competition and allows for mutual support allowing for more specialization. They fund many voyages and projects through an investment system, whereby they sell shares that can be traded in on the completion of the project for slightly more than was paid.
