## Starting out
At the capital, you has just finished helping aspirant Leopold put pressure on another for having dealings with a 
group of rogue drow that were living under the city. Not being able to guaruntee your safety during the fallout, 
Leopold suggested you leave the city. The enchanter Bockle, enjoying being part of the intrigue without having 
to take on much risk himself, teleported you to Singedbrow, a quaint and relatively young school of the arcane 
arts located at a trade hub north of the elven woods between the empires. There you gathered yourselves and set 
out on the thousand-mile southeastward trek toward Claw Mountain. 
## Journey to the mountain.  
The first couple hundred miles of the journey was over small trade roads, bouncing between small villages as you 
headed south toward the woods. The woods used to extend much further north, but at the start of the war the empire 
razed much of it in a southward pushing campaign. With the war ending about 40 years ago, much of the area has given 
over to chaos and wildness as the vaccuum left by the armies vacating the space is filled with whatever moves in 
quickest. Here, the group was chased by a large group of werewolves patrolling the lawless roads for sport. Fighting 
off some of them, the group fled far offroad where they would be harder to track.  
Travelling through the outer elven woods, the group had no road to follow, but was focused on heading southward. 
The woods are notorious for being unmapped and difficult to navigate without a guide, but guides can usually be 
found if you are patient and avoid getting turned around. During this time, the group was stalked and attacked by 
a jeuvenile green dragon. The group pinned it when it landed and, possibly under the influence of the werewolf curse, 
mercelessly executed it.  
Deeper in the woods, the group came across a small community that offered up a member to guide the group on the 
two week trip down to the capital Larethian. The group traded and gifted trophies from the dragon, and eventually 
made it to the city. There, they traded some goods, got decursed, and attended an audience with the archdruid 
Thoroar Dawnforger who offered up a hippogriph ride in exchange for investigating a dryad's request for help.  
Some of the group went to investigate the dryad's grove while others attended business in town. The reason for 
the dryad's request was apparent as her grove had been overrun by giant spiders and ettercaps and she needed them 
cleared out to access her tree. The group burnt the webs and fought off the beasts, eventually uncovering the tree 
and discovering that the dryad was a green hag named Mathilda Pigtooth who paid the group with a summoning stick they 
could burn to request her presence. 
The promised hippogriphs simplified the rest of the trip, bringing the group to the Rock Fort, home to the master 
geomancer Rockfort and his apprentice. The flight let the group pass over the Blackmire, a large and untamed blend 
of swamp and jungle that spans the southern border of the elvish woods, and be within eyesight of the mountain with 
just a sixty mile hike over relatively favorable land to go. A brief skirmish with some hill giants was the last bump 
on the journey, and the group arrived at the mountain to begin investigating its current state. 
## At the mountain 
The mountain was weird. You spent a week and a half walking the nearly 90 mile perimeter of its inner crater, making 
brief treks inward and familiarizing yourself with the area. For the whole of the mountain, after heading inward for 
a bit, the terrain would change and you would find yourself in a more verdant area with taller, strange plants and 
inexplicably large beasts. Having learned what you could from brief forays into the phenomenon, you decided to 
try to trek to the center.  
At the center of the crater, you fought two giant beasts, each of which stood on two legs, three times as tall as any 
of you. One of the beasts had a distinctly unnatural look to it, and you believed that it was directly linked with 
the bizarre phenomena of the mountain. The fight was a sanity-testing one, where the seemingly unnatural of the two 
beasts transformed into something like a giant snake on two legs, and the world seemed to fall apart into blackness 
as you slew it.  
#### The first vision 
You had a vision after slaying the beasts. You could tell you were still in the mountain by the familiar rocky horizon 
on all sides. In the distance to one side, you saw hundreds of points of torchlight, and heard alien chanting. Much closer 
on the other side, druids ran around preparing to flee or fight against whatever was oncoming. This vision of what must 
have been the sacking of the mountain by Yuan-Ti over 200 years ago ended as the eyes you were seeing it through bolted 
into the night.  
#### In the Shadowfel 
You exit the vision and find yourself in the shadowfel. It is dark and bleak, the trees are blackened and twisted, and 
the rocky horizon indicating you are still at the mountain now looks like a million skeletal claws reaching for the sky. 
As you get your bearings, you catch sight of a luminescent white rabbit moving incredibly fast across the blasted landscape. 
Intuiting that it is somehow important to what is going on, you track it town and rescue it from some shadow mastiffs, but 
it is too quick to be caught by you.  
One summoning of Mathilda Pigtooth later, you are around a fire being introduced to a coven of night hags. You need the 
speed they can offer in order to catch the rabit, but for that you will need to do something for them. They have had 
their eyes on a death knight that, while far too strong for them to kill themselves, could be brought down with your 
help in exchange for their assistance.  
Picking through the cave the Death Knight after the battle, you gained some treasure, and thus completed your end of the 
bargain with the hags. You only needed to stomach their company for a few more days as they rode you around after the rabbit 
you needed to catch up to. And so you chased it down, getting sucked through a hole and out of the shadowfel. 
#### The second vision 
Traversing the planes a second time, you again had a vision of the sacking of the druidic conclave. This time you observed 
the yuan-ti up close, as a procession of their grotesque religious caste, dancing and chanting, carried a large black 
egg toward the heart of the mountain.  
#### In the Feywild 
You popped out of the vision into the feywild. The crystaline horizon in all directions was familiar enough to let you know 
you were still in the mountain, but otherwise the environment now had an aggressive hyper-natural feel to it. From a vantage 
point next to a herd of spectral deer-like animals, you could see that the heart of the crater was dominated by a blackened 
forboding area. You set out to there to try and see if you could find a way to free the mountain from its cursed state and 
get yourselves back to the material plane.  
At the heart of the blackened area was a gigantic tree stump, forming an ampitheater featuring a ghostly primal beast chained 
to a dais with a black egg festering in its translucent skull. Three dryads were there, beckoning you to put it out of its 
misery to free the mountain, but that they were too weak to do so. You attempted to heal the creature, but ended up agitating 
it into defending itself with summoned displacer beasts.  
While holding off the beasts, the dryads summoned a living statue to extract the egg from the beast's skull. For some, the 
egg was too similar to the one from the yuan-ti ritual in the second vision and coult not be left intact. Destroying the egg
revealed the dryads to be the three furious hags you had worked with to defeat the death knight, which they now had enslaved 
in the form of the living statue. Battered from the displacer beasts, the group was still up for a fight and managed to bring 
down the undead, and force the hags to flee.
