## History of the mountain
The Moon Circle conclave at Claw Mountain was by far the largest druidic conclave of known history. Over a thousand druids 
from powerful archdruids to novices learning their first cantrips were permanent residents there, and many more made pilgrimages 
from all over.  
The location is remote, protected by hundreds of miles of swamp or rocky foothills depending on how you approach it. 
The mountain itself is a collapsed mountain with a 25 mile diameter caldara filled with lush vegetation.

The mountain was a hub of spiritual energy, and this aspect only grew stronger with centuries of habitation by the conclave. 
Aside from the conclave itself, the mountain boasted several other phenomena and oddities. A gargantuan hollow stump, eighty 
feet in diameter was used by the druids as an ampitheater. Three tall thin trees, grafted and grown together as a spiral 
served as a place of hollowed ground and home to a coatl. Mysterious primal spirits roamed the mountain, appearing as translucent 
white beasts, seemed to be anchored to that space. The space was also known as being closely echoed in the feywild and shadowfel, 
allowing for easier travel between those planes.
