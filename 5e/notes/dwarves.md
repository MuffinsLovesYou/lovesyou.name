## Dwarves  

### Traditional Dwarves  
  Dwarves as a race have adapted physically and culturally toward an underground environmental niche. 
Their stocky frames give them the power and endurance to dig and live in the deep and their long 
lifespans allow them to gain the highly specialized technical knowledge needed to handle the 
challenges they face living underground. Their long lives and the scarcity of space and resources 
they face have created a highly conservative and hierarchical culture that values obedience and 
stoic pragmatism.  
  Hill dwarves, while less common than the deeper-dwelling mountain dwarves are known to be a bit more 
relaxed than their more conservative kin, largely due to the less technically demanding conditions 
of their shallower homes and their increased exposure to other races.  

### The mountain homes  
  A mountain home will be dug as deep and wide as it can support. Getting a new home to a state of 
self sufficiency for even a small number of dwarves can take decades as the logistics of water 
and air flow, waste removal, and food cultivation are established. Every step of expanding a 
home is dangerous and work-intensive as the dwarves have to move many tons of stone while contending 
with suffocating gasses, heat, flooding and other underground perils. The largest of homes, capable 
of supporting tens of thousands of dwarves, are the result of many centuries of work.  
  
### The pantheon and the Rift 
The birth of Kathuil created a rift in the pantheon. While the mother is unknown, Kathuil is 
unmistakably the son of Moradin. Moradin, in an attempt to bury the scandal, cast Kathuil out 
to die and be forgotten. Marthammor Duin rescued the child against Moradin's will making the 
issue of Kathuil one that the other gods could not ignore. 
A handful of other gods, driven by compassion or other motivations, and with the will to stand up 
to Moradin, joined Marthammor, splitting up the pantheon. It was not a violent split, and the rift 
gods did not represent a huge portion of the pantheon. But still, the conflicts of the gods work 
their way into life on the material plane and the rift added friction and complication to the 
lives of dwarves right before the Great Invasion would come to completely upheave dwarven life. 


#### The rebelling faction 
* Marthammor Duin / Muamman Duathal instigated the Rift by rescuing Kathuil. He is a god of wanderers 
and expatriates and has a surprisingly significant amount of influence.  
* Abbathor is a god of greed. He is not an official ally as Marthammor would not accept him, but he 
had a long-standing grudge against Moradin and as such was pleased by the shame and chaos this event 
brought.  
* Dugmaren Brightmantle is a god of scholarship and innovation and a close associate of Marthammor 
given their non-traditional tendencies. He is also a son of Moradin and severely disapproved of 
Moradin's actions.  
* Sharindlar is a godess of healing and mercy and as such, supported the compassion shown by Marthammor.  
* Thard Harr is a feral god of hunting and survival. His intentions are unknown and his followers are 
isolated, so there is no one to interpret his will. 
* Vergadain is a god of Wealth and Luck. He has a sort of kinship with Marthammor and 
Dugmaren in that his followers are some of the most versed with interacting with the surface and other 
races. Though a dubious ally, his reputation is not that of Abbathor, and as such, he is accepted.
