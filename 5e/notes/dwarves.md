## Dwarves  

### Traditional Dwarves  
  Dwarves as a race have adapted physically and culturally toward an underground environmental niche. 
Their stocky frames give them the power and endurance to dig and live in the deep and their long 
lifespans allow them to gain the highly specialized technical knowledge needed to handle the 
challenges they face living underground. Their long lives and the scarcity of space and resources 
they face have created a highly conservative and hierarchical culture that values obedience and 
stoic pragmatism.  
  Hill dwarves, while less common than the deeper-dwelling mountain dwarves are known to be a bit more 
relaxed than their more conservative kin, largely due to the less technically demanding conditions 
of their shallower homes and their increased exposure to other races.  

### The mountain homes  
  A mountain home will be dug as deep and wide as it can support. Getting a new home to a state of 
self sufficiency for even a small number of dwarves can take decades as the logistics of water 
and air flow, waste removal, and food cultivation are established. Every step of expanding a 
home is dangerous and work-intensive as the dwarves have to move many tons of stone while contending 
with suffocating gasses, heat, flooding and other underground perils. The largest of homes, capable 
of supporting tens of thousands of dwarves, are the result of centuries of work by several generations.
