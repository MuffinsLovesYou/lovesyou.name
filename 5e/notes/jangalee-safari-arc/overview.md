## New arc: 
The slaad fight was a bit of a mistake. Wasn't very satisfying, and it sort of blew up the biggest 'ingredient get' that was available. The group seems to want the 'safari' option that was presented, though I think a lot of that is more for the items than to get completely away from the rest of the story. 

The Slaad killed by the group belong to Jangalee Pashu. He is a merchant lord specializing in magical creatures. Some of his services include raising and selling beasts, harvesting materials from them, and setting up exotic hunting expeditions for the wealthy. Most lucrative though are mercenary services, where he can use his creatures as a combat force.  

As it is, the group just killed several of his valuable slaad. More than that, the gems in each of their heads are very valuable to Pashu since they allow him to control the slaads. He's upset by this, but is always more interested in constructive or profitable solutions to problems rather than lashing out. He wants to negotiate compensation with the party.  

He's gotten reports of a hive of unknown insect-like creatures in a desert to the east. He wants detailed reconnaisance to clear the score. Captured samples can get . He's willing to provide bonuses for going above and beyond. Capturing a queen if they have one is a bonus 10k. If they represent a severe or existential danger to the nearby civilized regions, destroying them or their means of reproduction is another 10k.
