# Bloodkith halls 

Bloodkith is the family name of [Venerable Eberk](#monsterbox/Eberk). As a 
child, she was given to a cleric of Muamman Duathal to be raised as a 
member of that priesthood. As such, she has not been a member of that hall 
or used the name for all her life. She learned that the hall had been 
overrun in the great invasion and had its entrance collapsed.  
Around three hundred years later, she paid for proof of pedigree and 
rights to reclaim the hall. As a last act, she is interested in clearing 
and reclaiming the hall, if only for the legacy of a family that no longer 
exists.  

### Location 
The Bloodkith halls are somewhere between Singedbrow and Battlehammer Keep 
in some foothills known as 'the crag'. It is hard to access, meaning that 
it is a couple weeks of overland travel to get there. At this time of year 
expect some freezing temperatures and snow, but nothing that should be 
life-threatening.  
The Crag is fairly barren, suffering hard winters as winds from the 
northwest blow over it and break on the Horizon mountains. The lack of 
easily accessible trade routes make it so that the area has only ever 
boasted very small settlements of poorer folk. 

### External Layout 
The halls are carved into one of several pronounced mesas in this area, jutting 
about 400 feet out of the surrounding terrain.  
A pathway is carved around the outside of the cliff face, wide enough for a 
small cart with a bold driver to work their way up. About 3/4 the way up 
is the main entrance to the living area of the halls. Just past the living area 
will be a slope carved through the mountain starting at the top and ending at 
the base, allowing air and water flow. 
All entrances have been sealed off with walls of stone identifiable by their 
unnatural smoothness. Eberk informs you that aside from the walls of stone, 
the entrances at the top and bottom likely also have reinforced grates. 

Stone Walls: 
AC 15. HP 50, Damage Threshhold 15. Resistance to piercing and slashing. 


### Kobolds  
While originally infested with goblins, the halls of bloodkith are now 
filled with a different threat. The Black Claw of Tiamat is a tribe of 
black-scaled kobolds who, for lack of a black dragon, are in service of a 
mad beholder. 

* [Phalanx](#monsterbox/kobolds/black claw phalanx)
* [Inventor](#monsterbox/kobolds/black claw inventor)
* [Sorcerer](#monsterbox/kobolds/black claw sorcerer)
* [Guard Drake](#monsterbox/guard drake)
* [Cave Fisher](#monsterbox/cave fisher)
* [Beholder](#monsterbox/Beholder)
* [Carrion Crawler](#monsterbox/Carrion Crawler)
* [Rot Grub Swarm](#monsterbox/Swarm of Rot Grubs)

#### Base Entrance
At the base of the mesa is a hollowed out area where a small stream, currently barely 
a trickle, exits from out of the mountain. This is not intended as an entrance into the 
halls, but is rather an air intake and water egress point. It has a stone wall barrier, 
and Eberk says there is probably a thick iron grate beyond that. If you can get past those 
though, you should be able to climb up into the halls. 
Climbing: Lower Shaft 

#### Main Entrance 
The entry path curves around the face of the plateau; though untended it is still 
servicable. The main entrance is apparent about 3/4 up the cliff face. The main 
entrance is a wide area carved out of the face of the mountain. About forty feet 
in is a small foyer with stone benches, where typically there would be a lit stove 
and some water so guests could rest and clean themselves up before entering. Just 
past the foyer is a stone wall. 
Continuing: Temple

#### Top Entrance  
The top entrance has been 'collapsed', which in this case means a boulder has been 
rolled into it to block entering. The boulder is about the size of a horse, drawn 
cart and likely weighs several tons (~8000lbs).

#### Lower Shaft + Fight
With care you ascend upward toward the halls (DC 12 climb). It is a rough-hewn 
chimney, roughly 15 feet wide, that may have been natural at one point before 
being widened by dwarves. Though wide, it is narrow enough that you can sometimes 
brace against the wall behind you. The climb would be relatively easy if not for 
the moisture, allowing lichens and algaes to grow on some of the rock surfaces.  
About 50 feet up, you see you are approaching what looks like a small shelf where 
you can rest. Due to the flatness, there is extra lichen and algae growing, with some 
brighter growths on the cieling.  
3x patches of green slime, DC 15 nature (intelligence) to identify. The slime will 
fall on anyone that gets near the lip to the more level area, which is a DC 10 dex 
save to dodge if it is known that it is green slime, else DC 18.  
The noise of the slime dropping will alert 3 carrion crawlers, two curled up on the 
shelf, and one coming down from above that will attack the group.  

The slime does 1d10 damage per round until scraped off. It deals 2d10 to mundane 
wood and metal. If not hitting a person, the slimes will slide down the rock and 
eventually settle at the bottom. 
Climbing: Floor 7

* 3x [Carrion Crawler](#monsterbox/Carrion Crawler)
* 3x Green Slime patches

#### Dry storage (Floor 1)
This area is acccessible via ladders since no suitable stairs have been carved 
for them. It is even more irregularly carved than the second floor, with most of its 
space having been carved out in pursuit of minerals rather than intent. This area 
was used as dry storage, having some of the least humid air in the halls.  
The kobold inventors use this as their lab. Their alchemy equipment is kept in surprisingly 
reasonable condition. 

#### Rooms and Work areas (2nd Floor)  
This area is fairly cramped and winding. The three main chimneys jut through here, 
with sleeping areas surrounding them to try and take advantage of the heat. A 
sleeping area is a simple cubby carved into a wall with a carved shelf and space 
for a bedroll and trunk for personal effects.  
Surrounding the sleeping areas are work spaces. These are not well defined spaces, 
but are instead just small carved out spaces with stone benches and tables where 
a handful of dwarves can pursue a craft.
Past this area, the upper shaft is accessible.   

* 4x [Inventor](#monsterbox/kobolds/black claw inventor)
* 1x [Spectator](#monsterbox/Spectator)
* 1x [Water Elemental](#monsterbox/Water Elemental)

Tactics: Two Inventors will attempt to firebomb anyone going up or down the stairs, 
attacking from a hole in the cieling about 7 feet up. Another Inventor and the 
spectator will come from the living spaces on the lower chimneys. The last Inventor 
will summon the water elemental from an opening over the forge.  
The Inventors prefer to stay up top and lob artillery. 
The spectator will alternate damage beams and one of the other rays at random. If approached, 
it will try to fly up or down to escape before attacking again. 
The elemental charges in, whelming when available and otherwise slamming. If it gets a 
grapple, it will try to drag someone down the forge chimney.

#### Temple (3rd Floor)
Past the main entrance, the path is fairly straight and slopes gently upward. For 
the most part it is about 10 feet wide and roughly but regularly hewn. About a 
quarter mile in, it widens to 15 feet and you can see where someone was working on 
widening it in order to convert it into a stone arch. Shortly past that it 
widens into a temple.  
The temple is a semi-circular ampitheater with the main path passing around the 
outer rim and tapering toward the focus point on the right. Rotted curved benches 
are pushed against the walls.
Past this area is the commons.

Temple Fight: Kobolds are using this as a sleeping area. They were surprised to hear you 
coming and are scrambling to get ready.
* 3x [Kobold Sorcerer](#monsterbox/kobolds/black claw sorcerer)
* 4x [Phalanx](#monsterbox/kobolds/black claw phalanx)
* 2x [Kobold Peltast](#monsterbox/kobolds/black claw peltast)

Tactics: 
Phalanxes will quickly pair up and hunker down, looking to control the center space.  
Sorcerers will mirror image on being targeted, otherwise will hit with shots of witch bolt 
or phantasmal force before retreating to dining area. If fight looks good they will stay 
and cantrip. Phantasmal force options: 
* Kobold Centurion illusion
* On fire!
Peltasts will hug the wall and fire volleys at less armored opponents, switching targets with 
each volley. 
Overall: Their goal is to tag opponents with DoT spells then retreat to the commons. 

#### Commons (3rd Floor) 
About 80 feet past the temple is a dining and commons area. Rather than being a single 
large hall, the area is a series of hewn alcoves branching from the main corridor. Stone 
benches and decrepit wooden tables line the walls of the alcoves. There are stairs 
leading up on the left of the main path and down on the right.     

Temple fight members come here to fight, either as an ambush or a retreat. 
Obstacles and traps,
Backup fight in case previous one was easy. 

#### Kitchens, Forge, Rooms (4th Floor)
Accessible via stairs from the third and fifth floors, this area is built around three fire places, 
To the 'South' are the two kitchen fire places on either side of the stairs. To the north is the 
forge, built past where the 3-2 stairs are. 
two used for food preparation and one as part of a blacksmith. Each fireplace is 
surrounded by work spaces. Beyond that are sleeping cubbies. 

#### Farms (5th Floor)  
The 5th floor contains farming spaces for subterrainean plants. It is mostly narrow 
spaces with troughs on the walls that can be prepared to grow the variety of hardy 
crops dwarves have learned to cultivate underground. As well as storage areas for 
any fuel, food, or other bulk supplies.
Past the farms, is the main acccess point for the mines.

Fight: Some kobolds have gathered here to mount a defense against anyone entering the mines. 
Tactics: 
Phalanx: Take cover and hold the bridge. 
Sorcerer: Mirror image if targeted, otherwise tag enemies with Phansasmal Force, then magic missile. 
Peltast: Maintain range and provide artillery. 
Inventor: Inventors are hidden in troughs (DC 18 investigate or perception to spot). If unspotted, 
will sprint at the party and suicide.

#### Farms (6th Floor)
Another farming level, mostly devoted to 'scraper' farming, where various fungi are 
grown on logs, refuse, or even bare rock to be harvested by being scraped off. 

#### Cistern (7th floor) 
This large floor is kept lightly flooded at all times. Large prototaxite mushrooms 
grow from the floor to the cieling. These help filter the water and can be cut down 
to provide fuel or building materials. Though largely flooded, much of the floor is 
split into different sections to allow for fisheries. The water is chill and can also 
serve as cold storage for preservation. 
This area connects to the lower shaft.

Fight: You hear the sound of a tiny bell coming from one of the pools. 
* 2x [Sorcerer](#monsterbox/kobolds/black claw sorcerer)
* 2x [Guard Drake](#monsterbox/guard drake)
* 3x [Cave Fisher](#monsterbox/cave fisher)
Tactics: 
The bell is to attract people to the cave fisher pool. DC 24 perception to spot the fishers. 
The fishers will attack shortly after someone enters the pool. 
The guard drakes will be loosed as soon as the fishers attack. 
The sorcerers will cast phantasmal force and attempt to swim and hide. 

#### Mines 
The mines are winding, having been built around chasing any reasonable looking seam 
of copper or lode of minerals. Small kobolds can be found throughout, but with no 
place to run and little combat skills, they offer little challenge.  
There is a wide-ish main path with ample signs of kobolds having moved up and down it 
repeatedly. It terminates by heading down into a pool, but the footsteps leading into 
the water suggest you can swim to the other side. 

#### Marduk's Lair: Surfacing on the other side of the pool of water, you are in a 
large open space about 100ft long and 60 wide. At the far end is a ramp, with stone 
pillars at the top (half cover). A voice comes from the other side of the wall 
'no escape escape escape'
The group can attempt to flee. The mines will be filled with a poison gas that 
suffocates each round. It deals 2d6 poison damage each round with a DC 14 constitution 
save for half. It will take about 10 rounds to escape. 

Mad Marduk

    appendages that attempt to grapple anything within 10 feet. 
    DC 15 athletics or acrobatics to escape
    * An eye opens on a space within 60 feet of the beholder. A random eye ray shoots.

#### Treasure: 
A full clear nets this treasure. The crown and maul are with Marduk, 
The potions are in the dry storage. 

* 1x Bronze crown (250gp) worn by Marduk 
* Set of highly ornate flasks and bottles 250gp/ea 
    * 1x Quartz bottle. 
    * 3x Bronze with malachite
    * 2x Silver and Copper. 
        * These contain potions of superior healing 8d4+8
* 1x Ornate Maul (7500, Eberk claims)
* 2x Bronze framed silver mirrors with quality glass 750gp/ea
* 1x Potion of Climbinb 
* 1x Oil of Slipperiness 
* 1x Dust of Disappearance 
* 17 malachite 10gp/ea
* 9 turqoise 10gp/ea
* 8 azurite 10gp/ea 
* 4x tourmaline 100gp/ea
* 729gp
* 1189sp
* 1900cp
* Deed to the halls. In its current state, the halls and land around them are worth about 1500-2000gp. If 
the halls were populated and in good condition, the value would be just upwards of 10000gp, especially 
given that it has active bearing mines. Hirelings can bring it up to operational status, after which, 
it wouldn't be too hard to find settling families to move in.  
If Flaggfur owns the deed and brings the halls up to working status, he will have not only citizenship, but 
minor nobility, enough that 'Lord' will be a full and proper title.
It will take about 20 skilled and 40 unskilled hirelings a year of work to bring the halls up to livable 
conditions at a cost of about 50gp/day. Some one-time expenses might also be incurred to get raw materials 
drawn in. 
Once families move in, they can start taking over for the workers, eventually bringing the halls up to 
self-sufficiency. After that, modest taxation should be able to generate about 200gp/year from the halls. 

#### The Covenant Hammer 
Weapon (Maul), very rare (requires attunement by a divine spellcaster)
This weapon grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls. On a hit it deals an additional 
1d8 lightning damage.  
The weapon allows the user to use the Divine Intervention skill like a 20th level cleric once 
every 30 days. 


#### Flaggfur and Vergadain
Eberk knows something is wrong with Flaggfur. It isn't unbelievable that Kathuil is granting someone 
divine powers, but what Eberk knows is that this came as a complete surprise to Kathuil, suggesting he 
is not the source of the powers. Part of the motivation of reclaiming the halls is getting access to 
The Covenant Hammer, a relic of her clan.  
The hammer allows a divine caster to commune directly with their god. She is interested in seeing who 
responds if Kathuil uses it.  

If the hammer is used, Kathuil will not respond. Instead, the call is answered by Vergadain, a dwarven 
diety of Wealth and Luck; one of the few dieties that sided with Muamman Duathal during the rift sparked 
by Kathuil's birth. He appears as a 5 foot tall dwarf dressed as a merchant with yellow robes, a harp 
across his back, and trader's instruments like scales, calipers, and a monacle hanging from his neck.

If interrogated he will answer for his motivations.  
* His initial support of Kathuil was because he desired the social upheaval, which he felt he could 
help steer into an age of prosperity.
* While this has so far been successful, he feels like Kathuil's presence is starting to hold things 
back, keeping dwarves in a mindset of stoic militarism and mild xenophobia. 
* He listened for and heard Flaggfur's prayers and decided to use him as a catalyst to try and steer 
Kathuil toward the path of full divinity. 

As far as he is concerned, that part of his plan is already a success in motion. With that said though, 
having been called here, and shown he no longer really needs to supply Flaggfur with power.
