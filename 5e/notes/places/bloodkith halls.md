# Bloodkith halls 

Bloodkith is the family name of [Venerable Eberk](#monsterbox/Eberk). As a 
child, she was given to a cleric of Muamman Duathal to be raised as a 
member of that priesthood. As such, she has not been a member of that hall 
or used the name for all her life. She learned that the hall had been 
overrun in the great invasion and had its entrance collapsed.  
Around three hundred years later, she paid for proof of pedigree and 
rights to reclaim the hall. As a last act, she is interested in clearing 
and reclaiming the hall, if only for the legacy of a family that no longer 
exists.  


## Kobolds  

While originally infested with goblins, the halls of bloodkith are now 
filled with a different threat. The Black Claw of Tiamat is a tribe of 
black-scaled kobolds who, for lack of a black dragon, are in service of a 
mad beholder. 

## Location 
The bloodkith hall is a couple days travel east from Singedbrow. It is 
geographically closer to the Battlehammer fortress, but on the other 
side of the mountain. At this time of year expect freezing temperatures 
and snow.  
The hall is in some nondescript foothills west of the Horizon mountains. 
The Horizons have many strong fortresses and halls due to it traditionally 
being one of the primary bulwarks against dangers coming from the east. 
The foothills to the west traditionally were a blend of poorer mountain and 
hill dwarf halls, often just supporting a couple small families. The 
area is difficult to travel and does not support much trade. Likewise it 
does not sport many natural resources other than wood and stone. 

## Layout 
At its peak, the hall supported 15 families for around 200 dwarves. 
They were mountain dwarves and so focused on a depth-first architecture 
with extra work going into ventillation and water flow than would otherwise 
be needed in a shallower hill dwarf hall. 
The hall has about 6 functional levels. 

4 smoke stacks 2 for level 2 
1 for level 3 
1 for level 4 

assume food wasn't self-sufficient, the farm output was supplemented by 
external stuff 

acre is about 200 x 200 feet 
200 acres then about 
40000 x 40000 feet, massive 

20000 x 20000 per floor if 2 floors 

10000 x 10000 per floor if 4 floors *

damn, even cutting that in half gets us a mile suare of farm 
we have to assume much higher yield, and much more 
external supplementation. 
which functionally drops our count of kobolds below 100, which is fine. 
though also the kobolds probably have very low caloric requirements. 



Floors: 

1 Storage, preservation, some private rooms on the outside
2 Kitchens, Forges  
3 Commons,
4 farm 1  
5 family spaces
6 farm 2 
7 cistern farm 3, cold storage


#### Cistern and flooding: 
A natural underground spring itermittently flows depending on snowmelt. 
Its water feeds into a 


how many dwarves were there, 
it wasn't a big hall, but was also not just a single family thing, 
more like a small town. 
so maybe 100-200 dwarves
