## The Necropolis  
The necropolis is a community of powerful undead located 
in the middle of the sweep. It uses the isolation provided 
by the terrain to enforce its seclusion. Powerful undead 
can come here to live either in solitude, or surrounded by 
their peers. 

### Description
Approaching from the distance, the Necropolis looks like a small 
oddly shaped mountain rising up from the flatness of the Sweep. Closer, 
it is a field of jagged artificial ramps that lift the wind, increasing 
in height until the innermost four, which are artificial hills a half a 
kilometer in height.  
Inside this space, the air is calm and stays above freezing. Here you 
will find the estates of some of the most powerful inhabitants of the Necropolis, 
each built with a different aesthetic and style. Only the most powerful can 
have their own space up top. For the rest, they either live as minions, or have 
their own more modest tombs underground or built into the hills.  
The above ground homes are done in radically different styles. You see one 
that looks like a stone pyramid with a single entrance. Another looks like a 
modern country mansion. Servants and minions can be seen going about their 
business, but what you distinctly do not see is guards. Your greatest 
protection it seems is that no one here would expect you.  

### Residents 
The master of this place is the original archlich that created it. Their 
history is lost save for their name is etymologically linked to the word 
'prodigy'. In their day, they were a brilliant wizard, learning so fast that 
some thought they even rivaled Vecna. Instead of seeking dominion or 
ascending to godhood though, this one grew reclusive. They transformed and 
disappeared to create this place where they can rest. Few of the inhabitants 
here have ever seen or spoken to them.  

Some Notable Inhabitants: 
    * The Black Dracolich Arthyxharl has their aerie atop the westernmost 
    inner hill. They are one of the few creatures that can battle the winds 
    of the sweep. The aerie is bare marble surrounded with columns. Arthyxharl 
    rests in a worn indention in the floor. 
    * The Nagpa Nelalwe. One of the 13 wizards that interfered with the Raven 
    Queen's ascension and were thus cursed. She resides here currently, 
    fed by a supply of Shadar Kai slaves. Her house is a mansion done in a 
    haphazard style (described elsewhere).
    * The Vampire lord Finare Haelond. Improbably, Finare maintains a well 
    maintained lawn with hedges and flower gardens. 
    * The dwarf archlich Funda, who tinkers away at magical constructs. 
    * The grand ooze Fleshcrafter. While someone could argue their undead 
    status, no one does due to the Fleshcrafter's mastery over form and 
    ability to assist with cloning or modifying the mortal servants that are 
    so essential to the others here. 

### Possible Monsters and Encounters: 
#### Cadaver Collector (Mordenkainen's 122)
    Funda the Tinkerer sends out Cadaver Collectors to retrieve the corpses of 
    goblins that enter the sweep from the north.


### Nelalwe's Manor 
This mansion looks like it was constructed entirely by removing rooms from other 
buildings and fusing them all together. It is remarkably uniform in shape, but 
consists of a wide variety of materials and styles. You see dwarven, elven, human, 
and gnomish influences. You see walls of stone, wood, stucco, and brick. The 
windows and doors are all shaped differently. It has gardens, but the same plant 
does not seem to appear twice.  
Knowledge checks: 

Perception: 
DC 14: Everything seems to have different levels of wear and tear to them, like 
the place was not built all at the same time. 
DC 18: In fact, quite a bit of it looks restored, and some pieces of furniture or 
statuary in the garden seem to be in the process of being restored. 

History:
DC 14: One of the trees growing is the type the high elves use in their architecture. 
    Surrounding it are blackened stonework pieces that resemble some of what 
    you would see in Larethian.
DC 18: One wall has a mozaic of a vase that once adorned the flag of a city 
    that was sacked a thousand years ago. 
Religion: 
DC 18: There is a statue of Lemmaegli. A god with no known existing worshippers. 

Successes: This place is a monument to the destroyed. Sacked cities, conquered people, 
derelict cultures and ghost towns. It may be the case that everything here was pillaged.
