## The Stick 
  The Stick is a large open air quarry located about eight miles north of the 
gnomish town of Toestub a little west of the middle of the Shatterplate continent. It 
is a large open air quarry that has seen around three centuries of digging. It currently 
has three layers of digging spiraling down with the topmost layer being around a quarter 
mile in diameter and holding a lot of the housing and buildings that make day to day 
operations possible. Historically, it has has a large population of war slaves and 
indentured servants, but with the war long done it has shifted almost entirely to 
hired workers.

## Architecture and Layout
  The mine is dug out into three tiers, each roughly circular and spiraling down 
into the next smaller layer. The top layer is a functional village, with permanent 
housing built up for the workers and a couple workshops set up to handle the needs 
of the population.  
  Most of the buildings are very simple wooden affairs with thatched roofs, bare floors, 
and adobe walls. The community has a tradition of contributing to carving out 
rooms from the outer wall of the layers, allowing for more comfortable places for 
older folk, clergy, and other respected members of the community.
  There are a couple interesting features to the quarry, mostly related to machinery 
and technology that helps with the operation of the quarry.


## Population and Culture.
  The quarry has a total population of around 2400. There are around 400 slaves, many 
of which are elven rebels that continued to fight after the war but surrendered and 
accepted servitude over exile. There are around 600 workers with around 800 family 
members with them. It has around 100 guards, many of which are trainees who gain 
experience training at the mine before trying to find better paying work soldiering 
or guarding at a larger town. The rest of the population is a mix of specialists, 
clergy, merchants, tradesworkers, and administrative staff.  
  Life at the quarry centers around work. There are few luxuries and most people live 
fairly sparsely. Toestub to the south is a frequent destination for day-trips for 
anyone who wants more interesting food, drink, or entertainment. 
  The slaves have their own living section with wooden bunk houses that house around 
twenty members and have a limited constant guard presence. Most of the slaves are 
elvish prisoners of war, rebels that fought after the end of the war but ended up 
surrendering. Their enslavement is part of a contract they accept to avoid exile, 
and as more of them work their way out of the contract to freedom, they are replaced 
with more common criminals beginning similar contracts.
