## The Thousand Kingdoms

Also known as the Thousand Needles, this is a region hosting a large cluster of 
clans and fiefdoms united by geography and similarity of culture. The number and 
makeup of them is in constant flux. For most of them, they do not control much 
more territory than someone could ride across in a day.  

Politically, the kingdoms maintain a constant bubbling equilibrium. A central 
tenet of their culture is a distrust of any one group amassing too much power. If 
one group is looking too strong, their neighbors will ally against them to bring 
them down. Except in the case of particularly bitter feuds, violence is often not the 
primary way they compete against one another. Sporting events, subterfuge, and 
economic pressure are the day-to-day reality for the different houses.  

Culturally they are very conservative, and celebrate a philosophy and aesthetic 
of the 'modest grandeur'. In all things they strive for a sense of robustness 
and adroitness, while also striving to avoid appearing threatening or inspiring 
jealousy. They favor the brown and grey of stone and wood, and blue and yellow 
dies made from woad and saffron. 

#### Population and demographics
Houses and clans are recognized based on their control over their land, and can 
vary greatly in size. The smallest ones could be little more than a single 
large family or guild of only a couple hundred people. The largest can have 
domain over several towns, sometimes with up to 15,000 citizens.  
The land is fairly rugged and the population is well spread out, so there are few 
places that would be considered cities, none of which would rival the larger cities 
of the empire. A typical town is between 1000 and 5000 people. Larger towns can 
approach 25,000 people, though these are often spread out over miles and can be 
thought of a several towns in close proximity to one another.  
Humans are the most common race, though the area does have some mix.  
The nearby mountains are too geologically active to support underground communities, 
hill dwarves and forest gnomes are not uncommon making up rougly 8 and 6 percent 
of the overall regional population respectively, though closer to 15-20% in the areas 
where they are most dense. There are some venerable elf families that tend to 
maintain a low profile.  
There are some more exotic races too. Goliaths will occasionally come down from the 
mountains for fun or to find work. There are the odd tabaxi caravans that come 
from the south for trade. 

#### Military 
Few houses can field more than 1000 troops. In such a situation, the force would 
consist mostly of conscripts and it would create hardship in the short term. 
For professional soldiers, the largest houses might have around 100 before they 
start risking agitating their neighbors.  

Professional soldiers tend to be cavalry, with there being a fairly well developed 
culture around heavy cavalry in the region. Conscripts will typically be archery 
or shield and spear formations. Other specialists are also commonly on retainer 
in a clan's forces. Rangers are valuable as game wardens and scouts. Professional 
rogues are abnormally frequent as saboteurs and assasins. Magic is usually learned 
through apprentice systems rather than from larger schools and temples, so the 
skills of magical practitioners are often in high demand.  

Conscription is rare, as is all-out combat. The goal of combat is usually to deal 
economic damage, or occasionally to redress a wrong rather than to annihilate or 
conquer. As such, professionals often have a chance to build their skills over 
a long career.  

If a clan grows beyond their means, or recognizes that they are becoming too 
strong in the eyes of their neighbors, they will sometimes form expeditions to 
deal with any regional monster threats. For the clan, this can bring in wealth 
and establish good relations if they eliminate a threat for someone else. For 
the members of the party, it can get them training and status, which can 
help improve their station.
