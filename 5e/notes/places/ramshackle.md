## Ramshackle  
  Ramshackle is a large sprawling port city on the west side of 'The Gate', a strait that separates 
the Estus Sea and the South Ocean. It has a busy and somewhat chaotic feel to it. Most of the 
city's day to day life is centered around the port where an army of laborers works to load 
and unload goods, repair ships, entertain crew, and try to keep track of the flow of money and goods.  
  The commercial docks are the most organized part of the city, having to organize the movement 
of hundreds of ships and their crews. Clerks representing dock owners, merchants, captains, and 
warehousers efficiently take payments and scribble down orders to be handed off to runners who 
bolt off to check availability and bring back contracts. Packs of day laborers laze around waiting 
for a request to come in for them to mobilize and earn their pay moving crates or plying their 
trades if they have any particular skills. Instead of city guards, hired muscle wanders around to 
deal with issues more quickly than justly since the biggest crime they are paid to stop is the 
interruption of work.  

### Architecture and Layout  
  Most of the buildings in walking distance of the port are wooden structures two stories in height. 
They would be taller but the entire city is built on soft sandy ground, causing buildings to sink 
unevenly over time. Each building is its own unique patchwork of weathered uneven wooden walls 
with slapped-on trusses and reinforcements, butressed on posts or adjacent buildings. Buildings 
that serve any particular purpose often try to stand out with flaking paint and decorations that 
might not blow away with the wind, but a lot of the city feels like an endless dull expanse of 
the same docks, warehouses, stockpiles, shantys, and small public houses.  
  The waterfront, particularly the south ocean-side is dominated by the piers, jutting out as 
far as they can to support as many ships as they can and the buildings along that area are 
densely packed and as tall ass they can manage. The north sea-side has the dry docks and a mix 
of lower and middle classed homes for the crafters. The west of the town further away from 
the docks becomes more sparse and lower-class, but also tends to be safer with a higher 
population of permanent residents and tighter communities. The main overland road into the 
city comes in from the northwest and sees most traffic from ranchers bringing in livestock 
and the occasional merchant wagon train.


### Culture and People
  The city population fluctuates a lot with work, but averages around fifty thousand. It is 
primarily (~60%) human with greater than average diversity due to the port. It has a significant 
(~15%) gnomish population largely built around skills with crafts. The rest of the population is 
very mixed with a higher presence of more exotic races or mixed races who either favor the 
diversity of the city or life at sea. 
  The culture of the city is an amalgamation of whatever comes in to port. Day to day religious 
observances are largely personal, but there are festivals to gods of sea, travel, and weather. 
The vagaries of trade bring a lot of unpredictability to the city since a bad turn of weather 
or fortune could mean uncertainty and scarcity at one point or it could mean an extreme discount 
on perishables that won't be able to be delivered. The common folk who don't work the docks 
often live quiet lives deeper in the city. The wealthy often keep themselves busy with managing 
their assets, and often entertain, or are entertained by, wealthier captains and travellers. 
  A lot of the city can be fairly rough. The movement of contraband funds a robust underground 
that also hosts occasional pirates or thieves. There are watchers and guards paid by the city 
but most justice is delivered quickly by hired hands (sometimes hired at the moment). There is 
a reasonably robust population of adventurers and mercenaries, but they are mostly lower-skilled 
and very transitory, finding work as guards and hands on ships. There is enough need for skilled 
fighters and casters to support a fair number of low-to-mid level adventurers.


### Features
  The empire maintains an outpost in a prominent area visible from most of the docks. The building 
is one of the only ones in the city that uses masonry. Due to the extra weight, the building tends 
to sink faster than others and incidentally is functinoally armor plated due to all the iron bolted 
on to try and prevent the stone from buckling. Wooden posts buttress the walls and are covered in 
the carved names of locals.
