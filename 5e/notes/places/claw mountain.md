### history  
Druidic training often involves years of deep communing with unspoilt wild lands. As such the 
lifestyle attracts many loners and hermits. Likewise, a devotion and spiritual connection to 
nature can give one a worldview that is askew of other participants in civilization. While not 
all druids maintain a hermetic lifestyle, groups of druids numbering more than 3 are 
fairly rare.  
Claw mountain was a historical anomaly. A town with several thousand inhabitants in the middle 
of nowhere that was also home to a conclave of moon circle druids ranging from ancient and powerful 
arch druids to novices struggling to learn their first cantrips.  
Claw mountain is actually a ring of elevated cliffs and hills about 50 miles in diameter; the caldera 
of a long-dormant supervolcano. It is surrounded on most sides by the Blackmire, a vast swamp and 
rainforest. To its south are the foothills of the rust mountains, which are arid, hot, and nearly 
impossible to navigate with carts. 
The conclave lasted for over a century, but fell when they adopted a non-neutral stance in the war. 
Chaotan was empress at the time and had begun a process of burning and clearcutting sections of the 
elvish forests to deny them terrain advantage and to goad them into fighting en masse in open combat. 
Some druids left on their own when neutrality was abandoned and others fled when the mountain fell. Most 
died defending the mountain, or in suicidal battle with the empire. 

### the gods of the mountain 
Some druids worship gods, others directly commune with flora, fauna, and the land itself. Other druids still
worship things between these two; abstract concepts of primality lacking in name or personality. Sometimes 
these concepts manifest in the material plane as something akin to gods. Several of these mysterious beings 
inhabited the mountain, whether drawn there by the worship and belief of the druids, or perhaps even born 
from it.
The Hunter - focused and clear-minded, waxing and waning hunger and satiation 
The Prey - taught and alert, a battle between vigilance and complacency. 
The Herd - comfort and care, the dichotomy of self-preservation and altruism

### dreams of a mad god 
The circle druids joined the war as the empire's tactics shifted toward the creation of a 800 mile 
siege of the north and east parts of the elvish forests. The addition of the circle druids to the 
fighting force gave the elves a powerful boost to their guerilla tactics, making the siege more costly 
to maintain by the day and unable to advance.  
Empress Chaotan's solution to this new problem is a prime example of her uncompromising nature and why 
she will likely always be one of the most controversial Emperors of the human empire. The Blackmire is 
home to many foul things, including many thousands of Yuan-Ti. She hired them as mercenaries to raze 
the settlement in the mountain and break the willingness of the druids to fight.  
What exactly happened at the mountain is unknown, but in one day many druids abandoned the fight and 
fled far beyond civilization. Those that continued to fight did so in a suicidal madness and were cut 
down to the last. From the mountain, no survivors have been heard of, and the few people who have had 
both the means and will to make the journey, have not returned.  
As far as what actually happened: The Yuan-Ti fulfilled their contracts. Despite the power of the druids, 
particularly in their spiritual home, the numerical advantage of the Yuan-Ti was staggering. They came 
in the thousands from all sides, not risking anything on a patient tactical campaign but instead a mad 
rush to burn everything. Some of the druids might have fled if it weren't for what the snake people 
brought with them; a large black egg carried by a hundred priests. The Yuan-Ti were not there merely to 
fulfill their contract, but to hatch an avatar of their evil godess Dendar from the corpse of one of the 
primal gods of the mountain.  
The druids could not stop it completely, but the ritual was not perfect. The god of the hunt was implanted 
with the egg but was not slain. Since then it has lived in a dream-state, twisted by the pain of its 
wounds and the incubating evil inside it. The dream state has been altering the land around the crater, 
pulling in the other planes and blending their realities together. 

#### interesection of planes 
The Hunter's dreams have drawn together the inner planes almost to the point of forcing them into alignment. 
The Hunter dreams itself in a prehistoric version of the material plane. The Prey, in constant flight, has 
fled to the darkness of the Shadowfel. The Herd has crossed to the verdancy of the Feywild.
