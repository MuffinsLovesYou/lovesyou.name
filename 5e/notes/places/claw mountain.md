# Claw Mountain!

### Location and Geography
Claw Mountain is in a remote, and mostly unsettled area. To its south and southeast are the steep and rocky foothills 
of the Rust Mountains. To its north and west is the Blackmire; a hundred mile thick combination of jungle and swamp. 
The mountain itself is a free-standing mountain that, in some ancient cataclysmic event, collapsed in on itself. Instead 
of a peak it has crater, 30 miles in diameter at its widest, with a rainforest interior.  
Like this but a bit bigger, forested, and more filled with ruins. (photo is of Ngorongoro crater)

### Historical features of the mountain 
The mountain is most famous for being home to a conclave of moon-circle druids with over a thousand permanent residents 
from powerful archdruids to novices performing their first cantrips. The conclave endured for over a century attracting 
druids, other divine casters, sages, and travellers from across the continent until it fell after siding against the 
empire in the elf war.  
The mountain had some other distinct features that made it attractive to druids. It is very closely mirrored by the 
shadowfel and feywild planes, adding to its wildness and allure to sages. At its center, is a stump of a tree larger 
than even the largest magically-cultivated trees. During the time of the druids, it also had a mysterious trio of 
trees growing together in a tall and straight helix.  
The mysterious helix tree seemed to be the anchor for several primal spirits that roamed the mountain like gods from 
a plane of natural law. They had neither names nor personalities, but instead seemed to individually embody concepts 
like the idea of the scurrying prey, the pack, the herd, or the lone hunter. The tree was frequently visited by 
good-aligned creatures and fey, with a rare few staying to live and protect the tree. A couatl lived in the tree in 
the way that their kind inhabits places of power. There was also a guardian naga and a fey knight who had befriended 
it and lived at the base of the tree, maintaining a temple there.  
### The sacking of the mountain 
When the war started against the elves, the two empires merged the northern elven forests and formed the 
'thousand mile front', a series of army encampments designed to provoke the elves into open warfare by systematically 
razing the woods. This led the Claw Mountain druids to taking on a non-neutral stance in the war and joining the elves 
in the defense of the forests. A mobile force of several hundred druids, including archdruids, supplemented the elven 
armies with overwhelming guerilla tactics that stalled the front for years and gave the elves a chance to possibly win 
the war through attrition. The empress made a deal with yuan-ti mercenaries, who swarmed the mountain in the thousands 
while its most powerful were fighting on the front. The destruction of their home broke the spirit of most of the 
druids, causing many to suicide in battle or flee the continent entirely.  
Aside from a sadistic nature, yuan-ti are known for their religious fervor toward their snake gods and for their dark 
rituals to bring parts of their gods to life or to try and ascend toward godhood themselves. As such, there has been 
a fear and morbid curiosity around what exactly happened on the mountain when it was sacked. No survivor has ever 
made themselves known or presented an account of what happened. Anyone who has attempted to visit the mountain since 
has reported bizarre planar disturbancess that make the ruins of the conclave inaccessible.
