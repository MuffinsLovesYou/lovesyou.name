# Claw Mountain!

### Location and Geography
Claw Mountain is in a remote, and mostly unsettled area. To its south and southeast are the steep and rocky foothills 
of the Rust Mountains. To its north and west is the Blackmire; a hundred mile thick combination of jungle and swamp. 
The mountain itself is a free-standing mountain that, in some ancient cataclysmic event, collapsed in on itself. Instead 
of a peak it has crater, 30 miles in diameter at its widest, with a rainforest interior.  
Like this but a bit bigger, forested, and at the time, more filled with dinosaurs. (photo is of Ngorongoro crater)

### Historical features of the mountain 
#### The Moon Circle  
Most famously, the mountain is known for having been the home to a conclave of moon circle druids. Over a thousand 
permanent residents were there from powerful archdruids to novices performing their first cantrips. Just as many 
visitors and semipermanent residents could be found there be they druids who wanted to visit but not settle, divine 
spellcasters on pilgrimage, or just sages and curiosity seekers. The conclave endured for around a century before 
its downfall.  
#### The World Stump  
Near the center of the crater was the stump of some great tree with a roughly 100 foot diameter, much larger than even 
the magically bolstered trees in Larethian. The druids had converted it into a sort of ampitheater, with a smooth stone 
floor for the theater, and three stories of seating along the inside of the stump. The name of the stump is a joke that 
stuck; the origin and nature of the tree is unknown.  
#### The Spirits  
Aside from its remoteness and wildness, one of the features of the mountain that drew in the druids most were wandering 
spirits. They had no names or personalities, but would appear as various ghostly luminescent animal forms. The druids 
felt that the spirits represented the idea of the animal, and that by studying the spirits, the druids could gain a 
deeper understanding of their wild shapes.  
There was a trio of trees, growing together in a winding helix straight up that seemed to serve as an anchor for the 
spirits. The tree was frequently visited by fey and good-aligned creatures. It had a couatl living in its branches 
in the way that their kind often inhabit places of power. A fey knight and guardian naga had befriended the coatl and 
lived in a small temple they maintained at the tree's base. 
### The sacking of the mountain 
When the elf war started, the Joined States (non dwarven empire) formed the 'Thousand Mile Front', a series of encampments 
and fortifications along the northern edge of the forests designed to provoke the elves into open battle by systematically 
razing the woods. This led the Claw Mountain druids to taking on a non-neutral stance in the war and joining the elves 
in the defense of the forests. A mobile force of several hundred druids supplemented the elven guerilla tactics, stalling 
the front and giving the elves a chance to possibly win the war through attrition. The empress made a deal with yuan-ti 
mercenaries, who swarmed the mountain while its most powerful were fighting on the front. The destruction of their home 
broke the spirit of most of the druids after which most either fled the continent or died in battle.  
Aside from a sadistic nature, yuan-ti are known for their religious fervor toward their snake gods and for the dark 
rituals they use to bring their gods to life or to try and ascend toward godhood themselves. As such, there has been 
a fear and morbid curiosity around what exactly happened on the mountain when it was sacked. No survivor has ever 
made themselves known or presented an account of what happened. Anyone who has attempted to visit the mountain since 
has reported bizarre planar disturbancess that make the ruins of the conclave inaccessible. 

### As it happened:  
Couatl inabit and protect places of power. They know when they will die, but not how or whether they will save what 
they try to protect. Before dying they will often mate, a once in a lifetime event of spectactular lights and magic 
in the sky. Shortly after the Claw Mountain couatl mated, reports of Yuan-Ti movements came in causing a panic amongst 
the druids who had not left to join the front.  
The fey knight, an oath of the anicients paladin, that protected the spirit tree feared that the yuan-ti would try 
to corrupt the spirits. They and the guardian naga decided to try and sever the connection between the spirits and 
the mountain by destroying the tree. This would mean breaking their oaths, but they felt it was the lesser of two evils 
compared to leaving the spirits accessible to the oncoming Yuan-Ti.  
They had to fight the couatl, which was still committed to the defense of the tree, and then they blighted it, making 
the tree crumble to dust. They died fighting the Yuan-Ti, but having broken their oaths, resurrected as intelligent 
undead in a shadowfel echo of the mountain.  
The Yuan-Ti sacked the mountain with numbers too overwhelming for any defense that was put together. Despite the hopes 
of the fey knight and naga, they caught a spirit, bound it, and implanted a blackened egg in it to incubate and hatch 
into a divine snake-being. The spirit was powerful enough to resist the egg and instead entered into a fevered dream state 
that drew in other planes, obscuring the material plane with its dream state and creating close connections to the 
feywild and shadowfel.  
And that has been the state of the mountain since. The few who would risk the trip to it would find bizarre planar 
disturbances and either leave or not be found again. The hag Aunty Lady Ghastly discovered the chained spirit and 
death knight and hoped to elevate herself to Granny status by creating an artifact soul gem from the undead and 
an artifact soul pouch from the skin of the unborn anathema. She formed a coven, but still lacking the power to 
subjugate the death knight, she waited and planned until an opportunity presented itself.
