## Toestub
  Toestub is a town of gnomish engineers, artists, and crafters, with a small population 
of about 2500 people, mostly gnomes. It is positioned a couple miles to the south of 
a large limestone quarry known as 'The Stick'. 


## Architecture and Layout
The town has a sleepy older downtown, where there are several burrows for more 
established families. The burrows tend to have above ground portions with 
timber frames and dry stone masonry with public areas and workshops, often 
generously sized for non-gnome visitors. They tend to be clusted closely 
together with just enough space to allow for old oaks to grow between the 
buildings. They are also connected by underground warrens with bedrooms, 
storage, and other areas private to the families.  
  An aqueduct runs adjacent to the old town, and under it is a younger town 
center that grew around the construction of the aqueduct and now takes advantage 
of the economic boost provided by the quarry.

## Culture and People
The town is fairly wealthy with several old and established families as well 
as younger artisans working to make a name for itself. Rural hafling farmers 
bring in a lot of its food and are a frequent sight in town, with some halfling 
families being multi-generation friends of the gnomes.  
  The community is fairly traditional. The older, wealthier gnomes act as 
patricians and support the budding crafters and artists.

## Features

#### Empire Liaison and Offices
The empire does haev a representative for general administrative purposes, 
including being the jobmaster for any adventuring tasks. The offices are a 
small bare stone building with little adornment, making it stand out for 
its drabness compared to the warmer aesthetic of the town.  
You would expect the furnishings to be sized for larger folk than the 
gnomes, but this place takes it a bit far. The liaison, Sheth, has gone 
out of his way to make everything just a little oversized. Desks, chairs, 
benches, and even the lone mirror are positioned and sized so that someone 
under six feet tall would find them awkward to use. There are even 
several paintings on the wall that are portraits selected less for their 
artistic quality or the significance of the person portrayed, but more for 
the expression of looking downward disdainfully on each of their faces.

## NPCs

#### Shethtendeliath  
Sheth is a massive black dragonborn officer stationed here either because 
he is waiting for retirement or because he annoyed someone higher up 
just a bit too much. He's aggressively cheerful, but always with a hint 
of either perceived or actual malice. He even has a practiced smile, 
not a natural expression for a dragonborn, that makes sure to reveal 
as many teeth as possible.  
He likes to offer guests a draft of his home brew, a strong distilled 
potato liquor with thick anise flavoring. It is vile.

#### Rita and Ling-Tse  
These are two human soldiers taking some leave in town. They are 
shepherdian soldiers, which tend to be some of the best trained in the 
imperial army. Rita looks a bit older and tougher has the wiry frame 
and dark skin of a shepherdian native, while Ling-Tse (introduced 
as Lindsey by Rita) has a broader framed and looks like a Gar native.  
They wanted to take their leave in the least soldiery place possible, 
and settled on Toestub.  
Rita is ~ a sixth level fighter. She fights with a shield and punching dagger.  
Ling-Tse is ~ a third level fighter. He fights with a glaive. 

#### Teedle 
Teedle Rumwhisperer is a sage and retired bard. She is old (~240) with rheumy 
eyes, and mostly plays and sings for her fellow gnomes in town. She is known 
to be in possession of a rope of climbinb that she sometimes brings out 
to do tricks with. She would be willing to part with it for 400gp. 

#### Wrenn 
Wreen Murnig is a skilled blacksmith, goldsmith, silversmith, and jeweler. 
For blacksmithing, he has several apprentices he oversees. He occasionally 
does contract work to craft ornate gem and precious metal pieces. He has a 
stock of gems and ingots to work with stored in an iron trunk with a 
masterwork arcane lock (DC 25).
