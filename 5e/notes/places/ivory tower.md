## Ivory Tower 

Whether coming from the west or the north, miles before the city is in sight all roads converge into a 
single path known as The Way. It is 50 feet wide, paved with carved, flattened stone rather than 
cobble and proceeds in a straight line, forcing the landscape itself aside to make way. It is the clear 
flaunting of the wealth and capability of an empire in its golden age.  

The straigth path of The Way yields vision of the city walls. The walls, like the road, have been 
constructed in the last fifty years since the city was named as the capital. They stand seventy feet 
high and are fifteen feet thick with boxy towers every five hundred feet and taller-still buildings 
visible over their tops. Instead of a gate, the walls bend inward at right angles, creating a half-mile 
tunnel with ornately carved bridges passing overhead inviting all to look up and feel humbled.  

When the walls yield to city, the roads split to the different sections of the city. The northwest 
part of the city is the Plaza, the public part of the governmental area of the city, with the private 
pacial area accessible through it to the south.  The northeast of the city is dominated by the Ivory Tower, 
center of magic in the developed world. To the south is the Old City, with a thousand years of history 
buried under its wild, organic chaos.  

The Plaza and Palacial areas are large and rectangular, framed by the imposing city walls, with the palaces 
acessible only via defensible bridges passing over the western road. It has been forty years since the 
city was declared as the new capital and while several major construction projects have been completed, 
many more remain to be finished. The areas inside of the walls are elevated  to make room for a combined 
sewer, with additional space reserved for future catacombs or other underground structures. The walls 
themselves extend two miles east-west across the north side, two miles north-south along the western side, 
with the eastern side heading south, but tapering inward along a curve until it meets the western wall's 
southern end.  

Where future ambitious projects are expected, large wooden structures have been erected. In the Plaza are 
the public forums including two ampitheaters, the portal, an open air temple, a park, and housing for high 
ranking families, distinguished guests, and their servants. One large (50 ft wide) bridge and several smaller 
ones connect the Plaza to the Palacial area with all paths converging into a single path through the garrison. 
Beyond the garrison are the palaces of which 13 have been built. The largest is the imperial palace, after which 
are two for the most distinguished of guests, and ten for the Aspirants (potential successors to the reigning 
emperor).  

The Ivory Tower, both the tower and the school named after it are visible soon after entering the city. The 
campus is dominated by the main building, on which the titular tower is built. The core of the building is a 
three level ziggurat 100 feet high, 150 feet wide, and 200 feet long at the base, built out of imported and 
uniformly shaped marble blocks. The buttressed and reinforced tower rises another 300 feet, dominating the horizon. 
The building is wrapped in a broad covered area supported by columns where many casters gather during the day for 
lessons.  

There are other structures of very distinct design throughout the grounds. The northern grounds have several wooden 
pagodas in different elvish styles surrounded by well-maintained orchards and lawns. The southeast has a building 
of strange bubble-shaped architecture where the transmuters, diviners, and illusionists often train. The southeast 
corner has much more conventional architecture with pubs, dorms, and housing for any teachers that don't have permanent 
residences in the tower.
