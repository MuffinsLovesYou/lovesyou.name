## Ivory Tower / The Capital
  Miles before the city is in sight, all the western roads converge into a single paved one known as 
The Right Way. It is fifty feet wide paved with carved, flattened stones rather than cobble, and 
proceeds in a straight line, pushing the landscape aside. It is the clear flaunting of the wealth 
and capability of an empire in its golden age.  
  The straight path of the Way yields a vision of the western city walls. The walls, like the road, 
have been constructed in the last fifty years after the city waws named as capital. They stand seventy 
feet high and are fifteen feet thick, with boxy towers every five hundred feet and some taller-still 
buildings visible over their tops. Instead of a gate, the walls bend inward at right angles, encasing 
the road for a half mile, with ornately carved bridges passing overhead inviting all to look up and 
feel humbled.  

## Architecture and Layout
  The city is divided into a couple distinct sections and has a very motley aesthetic ranging over 
different styles from different decades and centuries. 

#### Civic District  
  Coming in from the west along The Way gives the clearest impression of the civic district. The 
civic district is almost all new buildings, many of which are still under construction. It is north 
of The Way and on the west side of [The River]. The style is grand and open. It is wrapped from the 
north and west by the outer walls. It boasts a host of plazas, ampitheaters, and temples of various 
styles, but mostly boasting prominent stonework and well maintained gardens. To its south are 
several expensive townhouses for the incredibly wealthy and for prominent guests.

#### Palacial District 
  Below the Civic District, on the south side of The Way is the palacial district. It is walled on 
all sides, and is accessible via a series of bridges that pass over The Way. The paths from those 
bridges have to pass through the training yard of the barracks on the east side 
of the district. The barracks houses up to five thousand soldiers and its flat sanded training yard 
almost always has several hundred soldiers training in it.  
  On the west of the district is the palace, which when finished, will be a series of sixteen mansions 
connected to one another wrapping around inside the walls of the district. Currently, thirteen have 
been completed, eight of which house Aspirants. For space considerations, the mansions are of a 
fairly uniform rectangular design.

#### University  
  Before the city was declared as the capital, the university was the seat of power and wealth 
of the city. It occupies the northeast corner of the city, east of [The River] across from the Civic 
district, and north of the old walls. It has a lot of older, higher class town houses that are not a 
part of the university, but gravitated toward it. These are a mixture of stone block apartments and 
timber frame houses, some hundreds of years old.   
  The university itself has a mixed architecture. The north campus, now wrapped up in the outer wall, 
is devoted to several orchards and forests. Working with that, the buildings are multi-story wooden 
pagodas to blend with the aesthetic. At the center of the campus is the tower itself, with an angular 
three story zigurrat one 100 feet high, 150 feet wide and 200 feet long with dorms and workshops inside 
and wrapped in covered areas supported by columns outside. Rising 300 feet above that is the tower 
Inside the tower, the more prominent casters have extradimensional offices and chambers. There are other 
notable buildings around the campus for different schools and type of study. There are a cluster 
of shaped stone buildings made to look sort of like waves coming out of the ground at the southwest 
of campus. On the southeast is a library done in a gothic style. 

#### Old town 
  The old town is the largest part of the city, larger than the rest of the districts combined. It is 
a sprawling mess of self organizing and self disorganizing chaos with hundreds of years of history. It 
lies mostly east of [The River] and south of the university. To the west of the river are a lot of 
areas more decidated to storage and shipping.  
  Further north and closer to the rivers are more middle and upper class areas, and the city gives way 
to poorer areas the further it gets from the major points of goods distribution. There are several 
wide curved streets that serve as main thoroughfares, that then branch off into many minor streets, 
with split off neighborhoods the size of towns in themselves.  
  Under the city is a network of unmapped catacombs with old sunken streets and buildings, tombs, 
sewers, and other underground spaces.

## Culture and People
  The city has a massive population of around seven hundred fifty thousand people. It is sustained 
by large scale trade bringing in food and goods by ship and road daily. It has been fifty years 
since construction started to make it into a political center, and the power dynamics are still 
shifting in that direction. Before that for about two hundred years, its identity was defined by 
the magical university, which had the goal of solidifying itself as the center of magical learning 
in the world.  
  The demographics are really spread out. It is in primarily human lands, but the size of the city, 
the diversity of its needs, and the draw of the magical and now political nature of it, have given 
it a wide spread of races. It is still majority human, but races and cultures from around the 
world have some representation in the city and only the most outlandish of sights would draw 
undue attention.
