# Gingonol

## Description 
Gingonol is a city of high walls and straight lines. It has a planned layout focusing on even distribution 
of people and their needs that tries to capture the feel of a mountain hall, while supporting a major 
metopolitan population. It has uniform forty foot high walls throughout made of unassorted stones as the 
default style, but giving way to a diverse blend of styles and materials depending on the local population.  
The city's layout is based around geometrical population clusters with a recursive design allowing for smooth 
transitions between quiet home areas and bustling city centers. Beyond the mandated layout, locals have a 
fair amount of freedom over design, occasionally producing distinct local styles of building facades and 
iconography. The distribution allows quiet five table pubs to be in walking distance of thousand seat temples 
and the city supports a huge variety of styles and ways of living so long as they are almost all disstinctly 
dwarven.

## History and Location
The great goblinoid invasion overwhelmed eastern mountain homes and northern hill homes, driving refugees 
westward and eventually south as they sought refuge in homes pushed past capacity. When Kathuil made 
himself known to the world, he announced a location in the delta of the Blackmire that would serve 
as a refugee camp while the mountains were retaken.  
The delta is massive being the end of the colossal Blackmire river and other smaller rivers, all fed by 
the combined runoff of a continent. The area was largely uninhabited when the dwarves arrived. The silty 
soil and annual floodings made large settlements improbable and any smaller settlements would be in 
perpetual danger from being downstream of the dangerous Blackmire.  
Gingonol is situated on a platform of bedrock that the rivers flow around. The rivers provide access 
to the ocean to facilitate trade and travel. The soil is rich enough to support a large population, 
given some adjustments for the dwarves to learn to enjoy rice. The elevated bedrock provides some 
protection against flooding and, given sufficient engineering and resources, allows for more permanent 
construction. 

## Architecture, Engineering, and Layout
Most of Gingonol is planned, based on the original Four Century Plan by Kathuil now enshrined as a 
relic. The plans detail multiple stages of city growth from initial preparation to the completion 
of massive projects. It covers sanitation, ingress and egress, material tolerances, aesthetic, 
and defense. It is rumored that there is a rumored second book that anticipates and covers changing 
internal and international demograpic and power relationships for the coming centuries. The city 
is in the early third century of the plan.  
Part of the initial preparation for the city was the establishment of temple areas built to house 
over a thousand clerics. The use of magic in construction is uncommon since a camp of hundreds of 
laborers can be maintained for the same cost as keeping a high level practitioner on retainer. For 
Gingonol though it is essential as some construction techniques require stone to be shaped beyond 
the capabilities of masons.  
The city is built on top of a lattice of stone piles driven through the soil and into the bedrock. 
In many cases, the pillars are concrete poured around fingerwidth-thick iron rods. For the largest 
of buildings though, Kathuil specified that the piles had to be of granite magically shaped around 
rods in order to withstand the weight they would hold. The elevated nature of the city provides 
protection against flooding, irrigated sewers, and subterrainean construction. Central to the design 
of the city is the idea of clusters of residential areas surrounding public shapce with groups of 
three houses around a courtyard at the small end up to groups of four burroughs of over 800 houses 
surrounding civic areas with large stone structures and areas of congregation for the events and 
celebrations of the city.
