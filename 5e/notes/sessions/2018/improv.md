## 12/9, snowed in improv session. 

### Background  
Word has come in, Leopold, first scion of the Whitegold house has been 
murdered by some decadent imperial aristocrat. Though he was just a single 
noble for a single house, it is unlikely that the people of the Thousand 
Kingdoms will respond to this with diplomacy.  
The Thousand Kingdoms is large collective of feudal states on the northeast 
side of the Istus sea. Ingrained in their culture is a distruct and desire 
to bring down anyone who gains too much strength. They maintain a tenable 
equilibrium through frequent fighting, intrigue, and competition, following 
a chivalric code. The entire region nas long been churning with transitions 
of power.  
The churches to various gods represent their own political power as they 
can arbitrate interactions between houses, and can even raise a call to arms, 
uniting houses against any one that has broken the rules of war or against any 
other threat to the safety of the kingdoms at large.
The distrust of power extends heavily to the Empire on the other side of the sea. 
Though it is far enough away, it is seen as a hungry animal, always looking to 
its neighbors to find its next prey. Recent years have seen the Empire building 
fortifications in the Uplands. These are ostensibly to deal with goblinioid 
incursions, but are uncomfortably close to the borders of the northern houses 
and have created significant tension. Leopold represented the strongest diplomatic 
tie to prevent those tensions from turning to violence. 

### House of Rubedo 
You are in the demense of the Rubedo, a powerful house with a focus on 
alchemical magic and iron production. They have close ties to the church 
of Heironius and loose associations with the Whitegolds. 

#### Henri Rubedo 
Henri is acting head of the Rubedo. He has just received a note from his spies in 
the capital that Leopold has died. He knows others will be hearing similar news soon 
and wants to capitalize on it as fast as possible. He desires war with the empire to 
disrupt their forts in the Uplands to both push them back and to secure better relations 
through the selling of iron weapons.  
He is cautious. House Galena and house Cadmus are working together against him. He 
wants to deal with this situation while not appearing too powerful to avoid drawing the 
ire of anyone else. If hostilities against the empire start, it might give him a chance 
to secure his current state better.  
He wants you to stop the bandits, hopefully for a while, and to get the church to start 
the call to war against the empire. You can speak with Baylee, who can cover specifics. 

#### Missions, deal with banditry:
Baylee: We've had trouble with bandits. They have been cautious, attacking every tenth 
wagon or traveller coming in and out. They avoid armed groups so we can protect important 
shipments, but it costs money to provide the extra guards, and it looks bad if we cannot 
police our roads and protect guests. 

### Bandits 
The party can pretend to be an unguarded group. Or they can wait for a group to leave 
unguarded and trail them. Or they can try to track the bandits.

* 2x[Scout](#monsterbox/Scout)

They have set up in a cave a half mile from the road, near enough that the scouts can 
take turns watching the roads and gather everyone up when needed. 
Treasure:  
* 8gp
* 45sp
* 20cp

### Galena Privateers:  
The bandits are being paid off partly by Galena. At this point it would be hasty to 
attack Galena directly, but hampering this particular group of bandits under their pay 
would give them some sunk costs and temporarily improve Rubedo's position. 
Baylee will give you a stick that functions as a scroll of heat metal 

* 1x[Bandit Captain](#monsterbox/Bandit Captain)
* 1x[Druid](#monsterbox/Druid)
* 2x[Thug](#monsterbox/Thug)
* 2x[Scout](#monsterbox/Scout)

Treasure:

#### Temple of Heironius 
Someone does not want you to make this journey.

* 1x[Priest](#monsterbox/Priest)
* 1x[Cult Fanatic](#monsterbox/Cult Fanatic)
