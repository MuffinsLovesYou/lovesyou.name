## Recap

The group returned with Eberk back to Ging Onol where she laid out the plans. Since she hasn't 
been in town for just shy of two decades, she needs a couple days to pay visits to people and 
catch up. After that, she's scheduling a teleportation to Singedbrow for the group to cut a month 
or two off the journey and to avoid having to travel in any of the oncoming wet-season storms. 

She took Flaggfur with her and left the group to handle any of their own final preparations. The 
group met up with Kit, who had been laying low for a couple of weeks. He met Havlan during the 
festivals, who warned him about an underworld bounty that was placed on members of the group who 
took part in the raiding of lady Sif's basement back in the capital. Havlan had crossed the 
continent to warn the group of a partnership between an assassin known as The Flayer and an 
adventuring group known as The Filth who were heading to Ging Onol to collect on that bounty.  

The group was ambushed, and managed to take down The Flayer, who was the only casualty of the battle. 

#### Heading out 
Eberk hears about the fight and moves the scheduling for the teleportation up by a couple of days 
to get you guys out of town quicker. It will be getting cold where you are heading so dress warm. 

#### The Rainy Day  
Though dwarves are certainly welcome, The Rainy Day is a bit of a haven for wealthy non-dwarves in 
the city. It is a block of three family houses that have been joined together as a single unit. 
One house serves as a tavern with an upscale kitchen, outdoor seating, and indoor private rooms. 
Another house has rentable rooms that qualify as 'wealthy' accomodations. The third house has a 
fancy tailor on the ground floor, and on the top floor are sold potions, scrolls, and the odd 
exotic item.  
The tarvern is run by Geoffrey, an older aasimar priest. The shop is run by Vlorg, a middle-aged 
half-orc wizard. General administration is done by Bifund, an elderly dwarven cleric and old friend 
of Eberk's. Aside from selling wares, Vlorg is a talented arcane caster and maintains linked 
teleportation to several significant locations. 


The place you are heading are the [Bloodkith Halls](#note/places/bloodkith halls).
