It's October in Ging Onol and the fall festivals are starting to spin up, which in this 
part of the world involves preparing for the wet season. 

### Recap
The group is in Gingonol resting, doing odd jobs, and taking in the city life while waiting for 
something to come along that is compelling enough to get them out of the city. 

So far in the city they have done a couple noteworthy things. They put on a play that became 
the talk of the town before the fall festivals begin. They investigated mysterious vandalism 
at a halfling dyemakers town discovering it to be the work of a adult in body and jeuvenile 
in spirit bronze dragon named Dinnedein. They sold off some wares and incidentally discovered 
that one of their buyers is likely a necromancer, who is now aware of the group. 

### Rayne 
Rayne has been praying and seeking aid for her condition at the Lode, the massive temple where 
hundreds of dwarven clerics come for their term of service. She has drawn the interest of some 
of the priests there who have been preparing a variation of hallowing to try and sever her 
demonic pact.   

### Fall festivals 
Dinnedein shows up for one of the festivals covered horn to tail in bright dyes, paintings, 
tattoos and prestidigitations. Most of the halfling village is with her, selling jars and 
bags of pigments at a premium. Dinnedein's feet and lower legs and tail are peppered with 
tiny multicolored handprints as children run up to touch her with dye-smeared fingers.  
Eventually musicians and food vendors show up and an impromptu dance is started.  

Various athletic performances and competitions are held throughout the city. The demonstrations 
of prowess are a celebration of the good weather before the rains come, but can also be 
important for increasing a dwarf's social standing if they succeed particularly spectacularly 
especially if against a rival.  

Similar to the athletic performances are various artistic presentations. Professional 
artists are putting on their best displays to sell work or score commissions from patrons. 
Citizens engage in competitions of oratory, boast, song, and story telling to improve 
or cement their standing in the community. 

You receive invitations to attend performances at The Rocky Purchase, a luxurious multi-story 
theater and inn outside of town where nobles will be putting on athletic and artistic 
performances throughout the day and into the night.  
It is an exclusive event. The invitations would normally cost 100gp per person and would not 
be sold to non-citizens (anyone who has not served a 25 year term of service).
