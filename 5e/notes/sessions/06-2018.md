It's October in Ging Onol and the fall festivals are starting to spin up, which in this 
part of the world involves preparing for the wet season. 

### Recap
The group is in Gingonol resting, doing odd jobs, and taking in the city life while waiting for 
something to come along that is compelling enough to get them out of the city. 

So far in the city they have done a couple noteworthy things. They put on a play that became 
the talk of the town before the fall festivals begin. They investigated mysterious vandalism 
at a halfling dyemakers town discovering it to be the work of a adult in body and jeuvenile 
in spirit bronze dragon named Dinnedein. They sold off some wares and incidentally discovered 
that one of their buyers is likely a necromancer, who is now aware of the group. 

### Rayne 
Rayne has been praying and seeking aid for her condition at the Lode, the massive temple where 
hundreds of dwarven clerics come for their term of service. She has drawn the interest of some 
of the priests there who have been preparing a variation of hallowing to try and sever her 
demonic pact.   

### Fall festivals 
Dinnedein shows up for one of the festivals covered horn to tail in bright dyes, paintings, 
tattoos and prestidigitations. Most of the halfling village is with her, selling jars and 
bags of pigments at a premium. Dinnedein's feet and lower legs and tail are peppered with 
tiny multicolored handprints as children run up to touch her with dye-smeared fingers.  
Eventually musicians and food vendors show up and an impromptu dance is started.  

Various athletic performances and competitions are held throughout the city. The demonstrations 
of prowess are a celebration of the good weather before the rains come, but can also be 
important for increasing a dwarf's social standing if they succeed particularly spectacularly 
especially if against a rival.  

Similar to the athletic performances are various artistic presentations. Professional 
artists are putting on their best displays to sell work or score commissions from patrons. 
Citizens engage in competitions of oratory, boast, song, and story telling to improve 
or cement their standing in the community. 

You receive invitations to attend performances at The Rocky Purchase, a luxurious multi-story 
theater and inn outside of town where nobles will be putting on athletic and artistic 
performances throughout the day and into the night.  
It is an exclusive event. The invitations would normally cost 100gp per person and would not 
be sold to non-citizens (anyone who has not served a 25 year term of service).



### Absolute Anarchy 
It looks like this rainy season will begin with a perfect storm! 

Actors: 
* Modrons : A past has been broken.
* Devils : You do not turn me down and walk away. 
* Rina and Kheinan: Whose side are they on!
* Assassins : Assassin hired by Aspirant Sif!
* Angels : Lookin out for their newest. 


#### Modrons: 
A contract has been broken, and a modron primus has decided upon a measured response. 

The Modrons are plane shifting in the forest near where the fight will take place. They 
will be fully summoned after the fight has commensed, and will not take action before that. 

They are single minded and not very tactical, tending to advance all together, reasonably 
tightly clumped. They will be satisfied to collect both of Rayne's arms. 

If engaged in conversation: 
The monodrones squeak
The duodrones quack 
The Tridrones chitter
The Quadrones humm 
And Pentadrone chimes

#### Devils: 
Maim, Duke of the Contract. Maim is an erinyes here to kill Rayne for the insult she 
has dealt his lord. He stands seven feet tall, wears black plate armor, and has a massive 
black flail (maul stats). With him is Scrag and several Spined Devil flunkies.

* [Kheinan](#monsterbox/Kheinan)

#### Assassins
The flayer is an assassin hired by Aspirant Sif. She has allied herself with the warlock 
Kildrak Brazenbar who is also in town to face the group. They met at The Soak, one of the 
underground dens, which is also where Kheinan heard of their plans.  
Astra is highly motivated to kill as much of the party as she can as she is paid by the 
per-head bounty. She will be less interested in Ulric as he does not have a price on his head.  
Kildrak is highly motivated to kill Rayne as that is his impetus. 

Level adjustments: 
    Kildrak's Mystic Arcanum allows him to cast Mass Suggestion instead of Finger of Death 
    Kildrak cannot cast feeblemind  
    Kildrak has a 250gp adamantine talisman that is attuned to allow for plane shifting to 
        somewhere in the 9 hells. 
    Kildrak only has three spell slots of 5th level, not 4. 
    Kildrak is a 12th level spellcaster, though his DC and chance to hit are the same 


Tactics: 
They have hired some thugs to clear out the town and beat the party up. The thugs do not know 
that Astra and Kildrak are there in the town. The thugs are not very committed to anything, 
and are not interested in a lethal fight. 

Before the fight Kildrak has cast: False Life, Mage armor, and Levitate.   
* He has positioned himself on top of a stilted house. where he can fight from above.   
Before the Fight Astra has cast: Longstrider, Cordon of Arrows x2, and nondetection
* She has positioned herself inside a stilted house with a Pier out front guarded by 
the two Cordon casts, and a window out back she can leap from to escape. 

During the Fight, Kildrak will try to flame strike the party if he can get rayne and another. 
He will use defensive fire walls to fend off melee attackers and will try to levitate to escape. 

During the fight Astra will snipe from the darkness with her longbow, expending hail of 
thorns casts for the first shot.
If approached by more than 1 target, she will fire conjure barrage and jump out the back 
of her hut to try and flee underground. She can hide in plain sight and if in darkness, 
is functionally invisible. She reserves her pass without trace for escaping
If approached by 1 target, she will hide and prepare to fight.
