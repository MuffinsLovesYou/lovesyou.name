#### Recap
Had all the notes prepared for this session already.  

The group finished up Bloodkith halls. There were a couple more interesting scraps with the 
kobolds, and the group went into the mines. They had a tough fight vs Marduk the Mad, finally 
bringing him down by polymorphing him and rolling a giant stone block onto him.
