## Recap: 

Super eventful session last time. Flaggfur established a pact with Vergadain, retaining 
his paladin abilities without strict adherence to his oath in exchange for being a 
champion of Vergadain in the material plane.  
Hearing rumors that the next goblinoid invasion may be upcoming, the group decided to 
try and bypass the front lines and launch an expedition deep into the wild eastern 
tundra. The plan was to teleport to the Ivory Tower where Bockle would secure them 
transport to the Thousand Needles.  
During their stay in the capital, divination revealed some of Feyrith's ancestral gems 
to be in the palacial district. He attempted an audience with Senadath Raemaoilin, 
elvish nobleman and potential successor to the current emperor to discuss the situation. 
The group was recognized by some of Lady Sif's spies and intercepted. An entourage of 
Senadath's people won the power play though and brought the group to his palace. There, 
Feyrith told Senadath not only about the gems, but also about Sif's conspiracy with 
drow and assassination of Leopold.  
Dusting off their hands and feeling like they did some good, the group headed quickly 
back to the tower, where Bockle teleported them ahead of schedule to the Westlander's 
Hog, a vessel under the command of Captain Anders.


### The Hog 
Anders comissioned the hog several years ago when he ended his tenure as head instructor 
of evocation at the Ivory Tower. It is a galleon with three masts, four decks, and a 
crew of 120 sailors. What makes the Hog unique is that it it is outfitted as a functional 
school of magecraft where Anders can train up to ten students in evocation-focused 
wizardry. It also hosts a temple to Umberlee where his partner Ianlin trains tempest 
clerics.  
In sailing, these are very in-demand skillsets and as a business venture, the Hog seems 
very promising. Anders has 5 students, while Ianlin has two acolytes. Aside from training 
on the ship, they gain access to numerous ports of call throughout the world where they can 
attempt to hire themselves out to wealthy captains.

### Work for the session  
* The group needs to meet the new character 
    * This can be on the Hog, or in the needles 

* The needles is building up momentum for their fight against 
the empire. 
    * Empire mercenaries and spies are wreaking havok
    * Some houses are settling scores or are resisting the fight. 

#### Privateers  
Paid pirates could be blockading the ports. Though trying to take on the hog might 
be a bit too much.

2-3 ships, smaller and faster than the hog. 

#### Assassins, marauders


### The tundra and the hordes 

#### The white dragons  
Every 75 years or so, the normally reclusive white dragons congregate to mate and 
share information. They have developed a particular sadistic love of terrorizing 
the regional goblins for food, pillage, and sport, so the goblins build up massive 
desparate warbands to try and flee the tundra and conquer elsewhere.  

#### The Undead Hordes 
There are massive sustained hordes of undead, numbering in the hundreds of thousands. 
The vast majority of them are skeletons of fallen goblins, but there are many more 
dangerous and exotic ones out there. They surround and protect a culture of 
intelligent undead and worshipers of death.  

They keep to themselves, but are very defensive of their privacy. It is hard to 
see their presence until one is several days into their territory, after which 
it is often too late to escape given the speed and endurance of the undead 
pursuers. Since the land is inherently inhospitable and very few people that 
venture there return, eventually people accepted that it was a no-go zone.
