#### Recap 

Having arrived in the thousand kingdoms, the group 
headed east toward Silverskein, where there was a meeting 
of regional houses to discuss war plans. The group met 
with Leopold's father and sister and told what they knew 
about Leopold's death, which will likely have an effect 
on the war planning for the regional houses.  
They then headed northward to Frostwalk, the northeastern 
most town of the thousand kingdoms. While Frostwalk itself 
is not in the harshest of environments, just north of it 
is The Sweep, a massive tundra with abnormal weather patterns 
that maintain perpetual heavy winds.  
They retained the services of three guides to try and navigate 
them either through or around the sweep to the mysterious lands 
that seem to be a source for the goblin hoards. 
* [Rokej](#monsterbox/2019/rokej) is a 'nilbog', a goblin possessed by the spirit of a 
    former goblin trickster god that harasses and foils the 
    bugbear and hobgoblin leaders of a goblinoid horde. 
    He makes the improbable claim to have flown here on the winds 
    of the sweep. To fulfill his raison detre, he is interested 
    in returning to the north. 
* [Iojad](#monsterbox/2019/iojad) is a Goliath Ranger with experience navigating around, and 
    sometimes in the Sweep. He is adept at practical survival in 
    the harsh landscape. 
* [Elarahal](#monsterbox/2019/elarahal) is an Aasimar cleric of Auril, godess of winter. She travels 
    comfortably through the tundra and arctic, visiting and seeking out 
    other worshipers of Auril or otherwise doing her godess's work.

The group has set out. Izzy received visions of landmarks from her patron, 
the Raven Queen, some of which Iojad recognized and led you past. Though 
not even Izzy can guess about what plans the Raven Queen has, they seem 
to be on the way north and it may be good to find yourself on the good side 
of a powerful force like that.  

### The Taiga
You leave Frostwalk in early July, prepared for a long trek that could 
take you through the winter. The first leg of the journey is through 
the boreal forests in the foothills of the Dawnhome mountains that wrap 
around the north and eastern borders of the Thousand Kingdoms. 
The land is rugged, blanketed in a green conifer canopy, interrupted by 
rivers and jagged outcrops. It is also land that Iojad is very familiar 
with. As you travel, he explains that many of the landmarks from Izzy's 
vision he recognized as ones he and others use for navigation through 
this region. As such, you are able to make good time as he knows the 
best places to ford rivers, the easiest passes to slip between peaks, 
and all the lodges and small settlements where you can rest and resupply. 

#### The Kith and Kine lodge 
By late August, Iojad lets you know you have traversed most of the mountain 
foothills and are ready to start the trek north. This also means you are 
nearing the edge of the places he is familiar with. He wanted to visit 
this lodge to ask about some of the other sketches made from Izzy's vision. 
Given that the ones he was familiar with, he hopes someone here can 
give him guidance on travelling to the rest of them.  

The Kith and Kine is small estate dominated by a large longhouse. It is 
surrounded by 15ft wooden walls, with the nearby forest cleared out to 
make for a lawn. It has about 30 staff and permanent residents, and is 
equipped to handle an additional 30 guests.  
It is a hot spot for the region's hunters, trappers, and foresters. It 
profits off collecting and selling the furs, herbs, bone, and miscellany 
brought in by its patrons. It offers hot meals, mead, medicine, equipment 
repair, and other services that can be essential this far from more 
populated areas.

#### Assassins 
The Kith and Kine is home to a few cult followers of Myrkul who serve 
and are tolerated by Brod. Another purpose they have is to help 
protect the Necropolis from discovery if anyone should be interested 
in trying to navigate into the sweep. Hearing Iojad asking about landmarks 
has put them on guard and feeling like the party should be dealt with before 
it can potentially find the necropolis. 

The fight/s:
Brod wants to weaken the party and force them to use resources. He will attack 
with vampire spawn, undead,  and ranged attacks. Then he will attack with 
hell hounds and some more skeletons. He will deny the group long rests

Brod can rage 5 times. When he does so, he gets +3 damage on attacks and has damage resistance 
against anything but psychic. 
The skeletons have double hp, +6 to attack, 15 armor (leather), and +3 damage (16 dex)
Histix has two healing potions, one scroll of longstrider (4d4+4), and one potion of haste

Fight 1: 
Their goal is a skirmish where they can gauge the party and expend their resources. They are 
happy to expend the skeletons and spawn, but do not want to put themselves in danger yet. 

Brod will fire a longbow, targeting spellcasters and low armor. He will be happy to tank light 
hits, but will not engage more than 1 or two people at a time before withdrawing, nor will he 
accept going below 50% hp.  
Histix will have expended these spell slots before the fight: 
    4: Locate person, guardian of faith
    3: Animate Dead
He will take partial cover behind a tree and plant the guardian of faith in front of him 
He will let his skeletons work as artillery, while he fires rays and cantrips. 
He maintains distance and will flee early if approached or targeted. 

The skeletons open early next to histix. The spawn are between histix and Brod, and will appear to defend 
either if they are pressed.

Fight 2: 
They want heavy attrition now, but still want the option to escape. 

Brod will fire arrows, but will approach and attempt to engage at most one or two enemies. He will 
fight more boldly, but will still escape if heavily outnumbered or pressed. 
Histix will drop his cloudkill and his guardian and attempt to fight from range behind partial cover. 
The hell hounds will charge and expend their breath attacks.

Fight 3: 
Depending on the previous fights, they may have given up (or died of course). But if they feel they have 
worn the group down, they will attack this last time. 

Brod will fire his bow but will either approach while firing, or wait for melee to come to him. 
Histix will expend guardian spirits and spiritual weapon and will be prepared to use his scythe.

### The Sweep 
Heading north from the Kith and Kine, Iojad continues to lead the group from 
location to location. They are not too hard to identify as the terrain has 
flattened out moving away from the mountains and so prominent landmarks become 
more apparent.  
Early October, you reach the last landmark that Iojad could get information on. 
There is one additional one, but from the details of the sketch it is located 
somewhere in the Sweep. From where you are, he notes there is a small river heading 
westward toward the sweep. It is no guarantee, but he thinks maybe you could 
follow it to find the last landmark. 

As you follow the river, the trees become shorter, more weathered, and more sparse. 
Eventually Iojad lets you know you are now in the outermost parts of the sweep. 
It is a vast, flat expanse. It is distinctly colder, chilled by constant winds from 
the northeast. The soil is frozen just a couple inches under the ground, preventing 
trees from taking root, and the harh terrain is covered by lichens and hardy 
grasses painting it in colors of red, orange, and yellow. As the trees fade, the wind 
becomes a constant billowing presence. 
Iojad's hunch about the river pays off. In the relative flatness of the landscape, 
one can see for miles from even light elevation. Eventually he spots what you are 
looking for; a large dark rock stabbing upward from the landscape.  
Getting close to it, it becomes clear the rock is not natural. Despite being weathered 
by years of ice and wind, there are clear seams and layers to it, showing it was 
made by stacking large black square stones on top one another. It has a curved 
inner surface, providing shelter from the elements. Inside this, on the wall, is 
an inscription in an unknown language.
  
Comprehend languages reads. History check DC 20 reveals this is an ancient form 
of elvish from another continent.  
The writing indicates that the monument you are under can be thought of as an 
arrow pointing into the heart of the Sweep itself.
