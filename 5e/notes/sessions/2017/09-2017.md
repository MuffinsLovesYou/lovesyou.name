The group is in [Claw Mountain](#notes/claw mountain)

### previously  
The group finished their trek to Claw Mountain with a hippogriph ride down to the north-side foothills 
of the rust mountains, followed by a 60-70 mile trek to the mountain itself. The mountain have what appear 
to be some planar distortions, where after an indeterminate point of walking inward toward the middle, the 
group found their environment shifting with flashes of differing colored skies and variations in the flora 
around them. The flashing would resolve into a slightly more lush and warm version of the crater with larger 
flora and fauna consisting of giant beasts. The group spent a little over a week walking the permiter of 
the mountain, observing the beasts and trying to make sense of the nature of the shifts.  
Finally the group resolved to head inward. A week of studying the natural, arcane, and religions implications 
of what they were seeing yielded only a little knowledge and intuition. The shifting that was being observed 
was due to several of the inner planes, the material plane, the shadowfell, and the feywild, being in close 
convergence in this place. And that that convergence was not a natural thing, but that the planes were being 
brought in by what feels like a force of will.  
Concluding that little more could be intuited from the parameter, the group started the trek inward to see 
what they could find at the center of the crater. 

### two giant predators  
The group had seen one of these beasts early in their visit. The beasts stand on two legs, flattening out 
when moving to be more than twice as long as they are tall, but still standing taller than any two of you. 
Their heads are large enough for any of you except maybe Giauser to curl up and fit entirely in its mouth. 
The two of them stand quietly in an aread they have cleared out on either side of a pit with some large 
eggs inside. 
One of the beasts looks distinctly different from not just the other one, but from the other 
large beasts you have been observing. It is the larger of the two, and its skin is dark with an almost 
purple hue being visible even from where you stand. It does not seem natural. 
[TREX](#monsterbox/Tyrannosaurus Rex)

#### more than they seem 
This entire fragment of reality is the dream of the Hunter, the archetypical concept of a natural predator. 
It has dreamed itself as a beast, currently content and peaceful. The second combat starts though, it's madness 
will begin consuming it and the reality around it. 

The god TRex has resistance to magic and 300 hp. 

* when shit hits the fan: (the smaller trex dies, the big one gets below 200hp. )
Round 1  
    The beast lets out choking pained screeches. DC 16 charisma save against being frightened.
Round 2  
    The beast lengthens to a bizarre parody of its former self. Its stands now like a snake absurdly balanced on 
    two legs whipping violently back and forth. Its reach is now 20ft. 
Round 3  
    The sun darkens, bringing the world to an eerie twilight, before opening as a giant yellow eye.
Round 4  
    The sky starts to dissolve, what was visible flakes off and falls down like snow leaving only pitch 
    black behind.
Round 5
    Tiny mouths start forming in the earth, everything is difficult terrain. 
Round 6  
    The mouths merge together to form larger mouths, They pull you down. 

#### seeing through the eyes of the Prey 
You have a vision. You are small, like a rabbit, and hiding in a bush. Drums beat all around you near and far; 
the air is filled with smoke and chanting. Something approaches and in your terror you bolt away from it. 
Shouts and hissing come from all sides and it seems no direction is safe. Sprinting over a hill, looking for 
some refuge you see a line of nearly a hundred humanoids. They are all a mix of human and reptilian features. 
Some glide on snake tails, or have scaled bodies, or boast reptilian heads. Some of them carry a sort of 
palanquin, in which sits a large blackened egg with a scintillating shifting surface.  

### the shadowfell and the dream of the prey. 
You all wake up, injured and spent, but alive. Observing your surroundings, it is not at first apparent you are 
more or less lying where you were. The giant beasts are gone, along with most of the lush vegetation. Gone too 
are the colors from the world. The ground is dark rock and ash, and the sky is grey and overcast.The only thing 
similar is the geography. In the distance in all directions you see jagged and forboding silhouettes of the rim 
of Claw Mountain.
The group seeks rest and to get bearings.  

#### identifying the Prey  
The Prey is present in the form of a white spiritual rabbit, fleeing everything. If the group finds it, tracks it, 
and saves it from a Shadow Mastiff pack, it will lead them to a cave that allows them to exit the shadowfell. 

#### saving the Prey  
A pack of 8 Shadow Mastiffs is chasing a white rabbit.
