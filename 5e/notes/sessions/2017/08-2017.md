### Recap  
The group came accross a small elvish community called Glade. They provided someone to help guide the group 
south  through the woods for a couple weeks to the elvish city of [Larethian](#notes/places/larethian). After over 
a month on the road, the group took advantage of the chance to spend a couple of days in a metropolitan area.

Rayne had woken up before the group arrived at the city, and heard the stories about the skirmish with 
the werewolf hunting party and the beat down of the young green dragon. Once in town, she cautiously set 
out in the evening to ask some clerics about lycanthropy, which led to an immediate searchig for and decursing 
of the entire party as the next full moon was just a couple days away and they did not want any risk of a 
lycanthropy event in the city. Erin fled, but the clerics were eventually led to her by some expert trackers 
where a quick remove curse prevented the need for a fight.  
Kit never got a chance to run. Aside from enlisting the aid of trackers, word of the possibility of a curse 
was brought to the legendary paladin Krismorel who got personally involved in protecting the city. 

The group sought an audience with Lord Thoroar, an arch druid native to the city. Intrigued by the group's 
desire to head to Claw Mountain, he offered the use of some hippogryphs to get you to your destination in 
exchange for investigating and dealing with a reported disturbance of some dryad woods a couple days away 
from the city. 

The dryad woods were covered in thick spider web. A dryad emerged from a tree and entreated the group to help 
her get to her tree. The group burned and hacked their way through waves of giant spiders and ettercaps, 
ridding the woods of most of the infestation and clearing a way to a large tree. Upon reaching the tree, the 
dryad went in and emerged with a [Green Hag](#monsterbox/Green Hag) before transforming to one herself. She 
summoned a chariot of vines and they rode off.  

### Hippogryph ride.  
It is still about 1000 miles to your destination, but with the hippogryphs it will be a lot faster. A laden 
hippogryph can travel between 20 and 25mph for about five hours a day, letting you cover the distance in 
less than two weeks if conditions are ok. 
Thoroar says that to avoid danger, they won't be flying you directly to the mountain, but will fly past to an
aquaintance of his in the mountains south of the location.
