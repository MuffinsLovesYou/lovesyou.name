# in the dream of the prey  
The group assisted a coven of hags who were in the plane hunting a [Death Knight](#monsterbox/Death Knight). 
It was a very dangerous fight, but the group managed to get through it. 

#### Death Knight and Treasure: 
The Death Knight's armor is still a serviceable piece of half-plate, but has not been well kept and would need 
significant work by a skilled smith to bring it up to its former condition. The original brown laquer has worn 
off except in the corners and edges, leaving the bare iron to slow rust. There are several settings in 
the helmet and shoulders that sport the snapped off remains of what were likely to be trophy antlers and horns. 

The Knight's scythe is aquired by Driftwood Sally as her part of the coven's bargain. Aunty Ghastly claims a 
tarnished copper and silver holy simbol, recognizable as the acorn and leaf of Obad-Hai, and wraps it around 
her hand. She then unhinges her jaw and swallows the stripped corpse. The much younger 
Ethel Bonechewer claims nothing as she is here only to curry favor. 

The inside of the cave is clean for a burrow of undead, probably the influence of the intelligence of the 
naga and death knight. While some parts are rough hewn, the floors and some of the walls have been flattened 
and smoothed with decades of patient work.
On one smoothed wall, painstakingly carved into the wall and then shaded with charcoal is a mural. With 
surprising detail given the crudeness of the available tools, it depicts three trees winding together 
to form a single tall thin tree. A hundred or more humanoid figures are on the ground staring at the sky 
which contains two winged serpents circling one another. 

The lesser undead apparently were seated quietly against walls when not active. For the bone naga, a hollowed 
out area in the floor indicates its nest. The Death Knight kneeled on a rotted mat. A rotted bag of its 
possessions from life sits next to the rug. In front of the rug is a gold and silver sculpture in the shape 
of a winged serpent, seemingly formed by the skeletal hands of the death knight itself from what metals and 
gems it had in its bag. It stands about a foot and a half tall and weighs about 10lbs. If you can safely 
transport it, it should fetch a good price (750 gp).  
In the Death Knight's bag are two once-fine flasks of tarnished silver and dessicated leather. They have 
glass panes on one side revealing they are filled with red liquid. Their wax seals are intact. Also in 
the bag is a scroll tube with two surviving scrolls: Raise Dead, and Dispel Magic

While travelling, Aunty gifts Kit with a potion of Fire Breath.  It smells suspiciously like the vile liquor 
he tasted earlier. 

In addition to what was found, the group can now get transported by Aunty Lady Ghastly on her wagon.  
With this and some tracking, they might be able to catch the white rabbit.

## chasing the white rabbit 
powered by 40 quicklings, Aunty Lady Ghastly's ride is incredibly swift (120ft movement). 

## Catching up to/tracking the rabbit:
This could be a couple days. Their plan is to harry the entity until it seeks shelter and to 
have it trapped there. 

#### upon cornering it: 
As the rabbit bolts, time slows down and elements of the world around you warp and bend.
This is a skill challenge: 
* It will last about 4 rounds subjective time
* Two rounds are required to complete an action
* Communication is made difficult

effects: 
* round 1: the rabbit bolts, time slows down 
* round 2: the world stretches in the direction the rabbit is heading 
* round 3: a black hole in reality appears in front of the rabbit, it is sprinting toward it
* round 4: if the rabbit is sufficiently slowed, the hole envelops the world, otherwise the rabbit 
sprints into it. 

If fail: Aunty Lady Ghastly makes an exasperated sound and you feel a wall of force lift you off the 
ground and throw you after the rabbit (2d10 damage, then successf). 

If success:

#### Seeing through the eyes of the herd:  
You have a vision. You feel strong but are also filled with wariness and caution. You are one and you are many, 
an individual and a herd surrounded by others like you. Smoke is on the horizon and you feel what has been a 
growing panic as it approaches.  
You are near your home, a giant twisting tree that bridges the worlds. An elf in brown horned armor and a large 
green snake creature are approaching it. The elf's face is twisted from crying as he lowers his face plate 
and sends off the snake creature. The elf kneels against the tree and performs a ritual. The rainbow bird-snake 
that lives in the tree tries to stop it and they fight and scream at one another. Then the elf then touches 
the tree and it is destroyed, parts of it exploding in blisters and running sap, other parts withering as if 
it had been dead for a century. Your connection to the world is severed.

## Welcome to the dream of the Herd  
You wake up. For the past couple of days your group has been surrounded by the desolate unwelcomness of the shadowfel. 
Now you are surrounded by the alien lushness of the feywild. You wake to a purple rather than grey sky. 
Instead of the trees being leafless and scarred they are now impossible explosions of color. The ridge 
of the mountain that dominates the horizon has gone from jagged black peaks to crystal spires thrusting 
toward the sky.  

About a quarter mile away up a slope, you see white luminescent forms moving between trees. 

The forms are a herd of deer. The herd does not seem large, but you cannot count it twice and get the same 
number of members. One giant stag looks at you constantly while the rest remain unobservant. 
If approached, the stag will shift its stare off to the southwest. You can see in that direction, about 
two miles away an area of darkness, reminiscent of the shadowfel. 

#### The lair  
As you approach the area about three miles out, the landscape gradually transforms. Buzzing insects swarm 
around pools of fetid water. Reptiles and amphibians, some unnervingly large, slink away as you trudge 
through. Crude fetishes are occasionally seen hanging from branches. Shadows move toward sources of light 
rather than away from them.  
At the center is the long-dead stump of a massive ancient tree, even larger than what you saw in Larethian 
spanning about 100 feet in diameter. It is surrounded by stone monoliths, and like the arboreal 
architecture of Larethian, it has a clearly defined entrance.  
The inside of the tree is an ampitheater, likely once a place of meeting or worship. At its center, wrapped 
in chains of linked thorny vines is a huge creature. It reminds you of the rabbit and stag you have encountered, 
except that instead of a luminescent opaque whiteness, it is dull and translucent. Mottled blobs of grey 
float within its seemingly fluid interior. It likewise does not have a single recognizable form. It's back 
legs remind you of a wolf, but with a pather's tail. It's front arms are a bird's talons and a single wing 
sprouts from its back. It's head is that of the giant beasts you fought over a week ago. Inside the translucency 
of its skull is a black egg sitting like a tumor.  
Three Dryads are on the 'second floor' of the inner tree. They beseech the party to put the Beast/Predator 
that is chained up out of its misery.

The situation:  
The dryads are the hags. They have been corrupting the Egg of Dendar, hoping to force the hatching, kill the 
aspect, and claim its body. The Death Knight is essential for killing the Predator, which is essential to 
hatching the egg. The Death Knight wants to put the Predator out of its misery, and destroy the egg before 
it hatches, but is controlled by Ghastly. 

There are three possible fights, two of which should happen depending on choices.
1. Help the Hags: If you help the hags, the Death Knight puts the Predator out of its misery and this births 
the Aspect.
2. Fight the hags, slay the Predator, and destroy the egg: You deny the hags and trigger a fight with them. 
You attempt to kill the Beast, triggering its defenses. During the fight, the Death Knight crawls forth and 
destroys the egg. 
3. Fight the hags, calm the Predator, fight the Aspect as it hatches: You deny the hags and trigger a fight 
with them. You find a way to ease the Predator's passing (the Death Knight can do this, but there could be 
other options). The egg hatches and you bring down the Aspect. 

#### Hags and Death Knight
3x [Night Hags](#monsterbox/Night Hag)
1x [Death Knight](#monsterbox/Death Knight)
    -- No Hellfire Orb 
    -- No weapon or armor 

#### Aspect of Dendar
1x [Yuan-Ti Anathema](#monsterbox/Yuan-Ti Anathema)

#### The Predator 
5x [Displacer Beast](#monsterbox/Displacer Beast)

All cases other than leaving involve killing the Predator and the Aspect. 

Treasure: 
#### Staff of the Mover  
Staff, very rare (requires attunement by a druid)

with it. The staff has 10 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily 
at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff loses its properties and becomes a 
nonmagical quarterstaff.   
**Spells**: You can use an action to expend 1 or more of the staff's charges to cast one of the following 
spells from it, using your spell save DC: longstrider (1 charge), spider climb (2 charges), water walk 
(3 charges), freedom of movement (4 charges). The staff can be activated while shapeshifted.

    - Primal chains : DCs for abilities granted by your wild form are set to your spell save DC
2. Gift for destroying egg 
    - Vestments of the Moon +2 Attack
3. Gift for calming Predator 
    - Allowing the Predator to calmly pass eases the Death Knight's burden. It will lead you to the 
    grave of an arch druid and retrieve the Vestments of the Moon. 
    - Vestments of the Moon +1 AC 


#### Totem of the Mover 
Necklace, very rare (requires attunement by a druid)
This item has 10 charges. While wearing it you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges 
to cast one of the following spells from it: longstrider (1 charge), spider climb (2 charges)

The totem recovers 1d6+4 expended charges daily at dawn up to its maximum of 10. If you expend the 
last charge, roll a d20, on a 20, the user is hasted, on a 1 the bearer takes 3 levels of exhaustion.



Naga, Death knight 

A Wild paladin and a Guardian Naga. 
The Yuan Ti were going to make their move on the mountain. 
They weren't just eliminating the druids like their were paid to do, they wanted to implant a god-egg
 in one of the primal forces of the mountain to birth an aspect of Dendar on to the world.  

 What evil could they have committed unrepentantly. It would have to be an attempt to save the gods, 
 maybe at the expense of the mountain.... An evil act to prevent a greater evil that ultimately failed. 
 That failure is the reason for the lack of repentance, as long as the results of the paladin's failure 
 is present, it cannot release.  
 They had to have killed something very good that they thought served as a connection to the gods. 

 There was a tree, a place of worship for the druids, that served as a planer anchor for the primal 
 spririts and was the home of a coatl, tasked to protect the mountain and fated to die in so doing. 

 The paladin, in an attempt to deny the Yuan Ti access to the gods, hallowed the tree and blighted it 
 (128 damage), then slaughtered the coatl.
