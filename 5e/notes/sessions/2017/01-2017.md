# last session/s!

## drow   

Shortly after entering The Ivory Tower, the capital city of the human part of the empire, 
you found work exploring and mapping some of the network of catacombs underneath the city. 
The work was lucrative but dull, though there were certainly some nasty things down there 
that merited the advanced adventuring rank needed to take the job.  
The work was cut short by the arrival of the Draco Ocul, a famous adventuring group known 
to work jobs around the Istus sea. They had been tipped off about the work and changed 
course to take advantage. They made it clear that their interest was in monopolizing the 
job of mapping the catacombs, but attempted at least a little conciliation by *allowing* 
you a section of sewers to map in the southeast part of the city.  
Some undead, some decent count of mapped square feet, and lots of ungodly stench later, 
you found yourself near the end of your alotted space only to be ambushed by a small camp 
of [drow](#monsterbox/Drow) led by two [elite warriors](#monsterbox/Drow Elite Warrior.png) 
(oh boy those images have been compressed pretty hard). You routed them thoroughly, capturing 
several and only allowing one to escape. Understanding something of the importance of what 
you found, you were deciding on what to do with your captives when you were approached by 
the gnome ranger Havlan.  

## havlan and Leopold  

Havlan is the manservant of Leopold, one of the Hopefuls, who represents an anarchic collection 
of feudal states known as the thousand kingdoms. Having little power locally aside from the 
prestige of his station, Leopold occupies himself with sport, intelligence gathering, and messing 
with the other hopefuls.  According to him, he instigated the comission to map the catacombs 
as a practical joke on Sif, another hopeful, whose servants he had observed going in and out 
of the catacombs.  
The last thing they were expecting you to find were drow. Drow largely serve as cultural 
boogeymen, in the empire as part of the penultimate threat of exile to the underdark, and 
elsewhere in myths and legends. Their presence under the city necessitated immediate 
action, but Leopold's relative lack of power compared to Sif meant he had to be as subtle 
as possible about it. Since your group was already involved, he made as much use of you as 
he could.  

## more drow  

There were several distinct points where Sif's servants had been seen most to enter and leave, 
one of which was in the home of an elderly retired merchant.  Investigating his home, you 
found stairs leading down into the catacombs. Navigating down there, you came accross another 
drow encampment. You attempted to parlay with what turned out to be a [drow mage](#monsterbox/Drow Mage)) 
only for it to end up in a brawl. Despite their evil nature, the execution of prisoners by 
Anna was too unpalatable for the group and she was asked to leave.  
You did manage to capture several more Drow, and were put on retainer for when interrogation 
of the prisoners yielded any useful information. While waiting, Havlan came by and introduced 
you to Giausar, a robust dragonborn with significant experience in the imperial military, but 
who recently has left and is looking to put his skills to use as an adventurer.  
Several days in you were woken early with news of the interrogations finally yielding useful 
information.  The next operation would be focused on Sif's palace itself and would take the 
form of a 'pincer attack' where Leopold would create a diversion of extreme social awkwardness 
on the surface, and your group would hit underground to catch any fleeing drow. 
The operation was a success. You managed to peacefully catch several servants who were trying 
to move furniture and artwork through the underground passages. Moving in further, you managed 
to sneak up on and attack a room full of drow, including a [drow priestess](#monsterbox/Drow Priestess of Lolth.png) 
and the elite warrior who had escaped you earlier.  

## a hasty exit  

With the priestess killed and the rest of the drow captured, that danger was handled, but your 
safety was not secure. The aftermath of confronting Sif head on was still to come, and while 
Leopold can probably weather that storm, he could not guarantee your safety from retribution. 
Using your contacts, you met up with Bockle ([tfw old notes weren't backed up](https://glyphpress.com/talk/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Roy-Batty.jpg)), 
at the university, who has grown much more fond of you since your first interactions back in 
Ramshackle. 

## singedbrow

He did you a solid and teleported you to Singedbrow, the dwarven university for arcane studies. 
The halls at Singedbrow were one of the halls that were completely overrun by goblinoids hundreds 
of years ago, the former clan having historically enjoyed the protection of being well insulated 
by their more martial kin. The surface and main halls are dominated by a trading post that has 
sprung up to take advantage of its position near the juncture of several roads. The original halls 
were plainly and openly laid out and much of the top level is used as storage for trade goods. 
The deeper levels house the small university.  
Singedbrow is much smaller than The Ivory Tower, with almost as many students as the tower has 
instructors. Dwarven magic use is fairly young and immature, much like many of its students 
(even some of the instructors don't seem to have hit a hundred yet), and the most commonly 
practiced magic is that of evocation.  
You did not stay too long, and instead waited until you could catch a ride and some work on a 
caravan heading south. It is a long way to your destination yet.
