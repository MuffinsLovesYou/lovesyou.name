## recap  

Heading from Singedbrow, your final destination is Claw Mountain, ancestral home of the Moon Cirle. In 
a straight line, it would be about a 1200 mile journey, but there is no navigable straight path. The two 
most direct paths are both arduous. A group could head east then south then west, following a network 
of trade routes through sacked lands and tracing the rocky foothills of more than one mountain range. The 
other path is to head south, deep into the vast elven forests, then either straight through the Blackmire, 
a swamp larger than some nations, or wide around it.  
The group chose the latter, and over the course of a couple weeks, have covered the first several hundred 
miles of the journey, making it to the wilder outer parts of the forests. The journey has been eventful. 
The group was accosted and then assaulted by a pack of werewolves who were out to make sport of anyone 
who looked interesting enough to chase. Felling several of the wolves and sustaining some injury, the 
group escaped in the night at the cost of their wagon. A week later, the group was entering the wilder 
outer forests, areas still regrowing after being scorched and blasted by the war and filled with a 
dangerous wildness. Here the group was tracked and attacked by a young green dragon. After a single 
successful strafing of the group, the dragon displayed incredible arrogance by landing to finish the 
fight on the ground. The group grounded and mercilessly beat their attacker, collecting trophies that while 
not exceptional given the youth of the drake, should still fetch some interest.

### rayne 

After leaving Singedbrow, Rayne seemed to be overcome by an affliction. Feverish, shaking, and unconscious 
she was bundled up and laid in the wagon to be looked after. She wakes and begins to regain her strength. 

Wracked by pain and tortured by visions of fire you lose track of time and self. You dream of dark jagged 
mountains and black rivers. You see a battle where the sky and ground are dark with horrors tearing each 
other apart. You wake in a small ornate library, the books are of all sizes and bindings, but contain nothing 
but blank pages. Out of the corner of your eye you think you see ornate wicked carvings in the wood of the 
shelves, but when you look all you see is bare and utilitarian. 
Outside the room is a much larger room. A large circle with a shallowly domed cieling, and hallways leading 
out in different directions. A tall man in black plate with red wings is training in the middle of the room. 
He swings a giant chain around him, swirling a spiked weight on its end through the air before smashing it 
into the smooth stone floor with devastating power. 
Seeing you he wraps the chain around his shoulders. As he approaches, you find you cannot move or speak. 

'Order and obedience are the root of power.' Holding up the weight of his chain: 'Brute force moves 
the strike through the air, but it is worth nothing without the discipline of the wielder or the authority 
that commands the strike.'  You feel a surge of heat within you like fire will erupt from your skin. 'You 
have been granted some small power and protection through a contract made on your behalf. Now you are old 
enough to complete the contract through your own agency. Obedience to the contract will give you the 
power to shape and control your world and those in it. Anything else and you will be stripped of your 
gifts and the grace by which you are allowed to live.' From a scroll tube bound to a sash around his waist 
he pulls out a scroll. He sets his hand on your shoulder, the clawed tips of his gauntlets breaking your 
skin as he puts the scroll in front of you. 'Bind yourself to the master of my master. Balance ambition 
with servitude and your potential will be unlimited.' You catch yourself as you feel yourself being released 
from your paralysis. A small rivulet of blood has run down your arm to drip off your fingers. Your arm 
feels light, driven to place finger to parchment and sign, but you retain control of it. What do you do. 

Infernal boon. Right arm of Asmodeus.

From the small puncture wounds in your shoulder down to your fingertips, tracing the same paths as the 
rivulets of blood is a tattoo of absolute blackness. The skin on that arm grows thicker and darker, the 
nails thicker than natural and tapering to a point. 

The arm has up to 3 charges. With each spent charge, your arm becomes more human-like. If one or more 
charges are spent, a single spell slot will be expended the following day and each after until all the 
charges are back and the arm has returned to its demonic form. 

You can use an action to expend one or more charges to make a melee attack against an adjacent creature. 
The attack roll has a +8 bonus. On a hit, for each spent charge, the target takes 2d10 slashing, blunt,
or piercing damage (your choice when making the strike) and pushes it 5 feet away from you.  
Alternatively, you can expend one or more charges to make a strength check with a +5 bonus for each 
spent charge. 

## Glade  

Recovering from the fight with the dragon, you begin heading southward again. The next day you come accross 
some elves. A loose collection of farms and workshops occupying a cleared out area of forest.
