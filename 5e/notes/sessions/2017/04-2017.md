## welcome back  

 Singedbrow has maps, and from them you know that your destination is over a thousand miles 
 south and slightly east. Between there and here are the forests of the high elves, conquered, 
 but with much of the heart of the forest intact. There isn't a direct route to your destinaton, 
 but there are plenty of options.  
 Many roads of varying age and quality meander through the plains and foothills that wrap around 
 the north and east of the forests, connecting to shallow hill dwarf holes and small communities 
 of various and mixed races. Much of the area was abandoned during the war as people fled the 
 hostilities, and towns and fields were burnt or became temporary barracks and camps. Most of it 
 has yet to be resettled, and some areas have grown dangerous as residual evils of war and 
 natural or unnatural chaos have filled the gaps where people once lived. For this reason, you 
 could travel a large part of your journey accompanying trade caravans as their guards, or simply 
 utilize the roads and travel directly on your own.  
 The forests are also largely traversible, though less so to non-natives. High elf lands, much 
 like their society, is navigable through intuitions developed over decades. What is or is not 
 a route is not always apparent, and you will be hard pressed to find any meaningful map. A 
 east-west road of sorts has been carved through the middle of the forest, with plans for a 
 north-south one in the future. Like the hills and plains, some of the outer forests have 
 grown more wild and dangerous where the combat was most fierce, but much of the inner heart is 
 undisturbed.  
 The end of your journey will likely be most daunting. The tall thick trees of the elvish forests 
 give way to a swampy rain forest larger than some nations with the world largest known river, 
 miles in width, flowing through it. 

 ## stuff happens on the road:
 
 ### Randos

 ### The Great Hunt (Hills, Forest)  
 20 [Werewolves](#monsterbox/Werewolf) are bored, travelling, and looking for sport.  
 1 [Druid](#monsterbox/Druid)
 1 [Big werewolf](#monsterbox/Werebear)

 A motley crew of about twenty men and women are loitering at an intersection. Most of them are 
 travelling light, are unarmed, and don't seem like weary travellers or locals. Instead they are 
 at various stages of resting or playing and running around. They look very healthy.
 As you approach, they clear the road for you, sitting off to the side to watch you pass. The largest 
 of them approaches and hails you. He brings out a map and shows it to you. "We have a game for you 
 to play if you would like. Well you see, the full moon is out tonight and we're looking for some sport. 
 There is a town about 30 miles from here that is small but well fortified. Anyone who makes it there 
 is free! Anyone who does not make it there has the option to fight or accept being bitten. We'll start 
 in about five minutes".

 ### Dragon Stalking: (Swamp, Forest)
 [Young Green Dragon](#monsterbox/Young Green Dragon) 
 Trigger: Forest or Swamp, lose survival check DC 16 

 After some trudging around, you realize you have gotten off course. On top of that, a faint green 
 mist with a bitter smell and taste has been slowly filling the space between the trees. DC 15 survival, 
 or investigation: you realize something large is hunting you. DC 12 perception: You see it between the 
 trees caught in a moment where it is poorly hidden.  A young green dragon is crawling low to the ground, 
 following you. 
 Behavior: The green dragon is bored and hungry and thinking it has a chance to get a meal, some entertainment, 
 and possibly some new items. It very much wants to play with its food, engaging in sneak attacks and flybys. 
 It can be bargained with, but it is not interested in communication. It would probably accept a flat bribe 
 of sufficient proportions. Aside from that, something it is interested in is attacking one of the black 
 dragons to the south. 

 2 [Young Black Dragon](#monsterbox/Young Black Dragon)
 Trigger: Swamp or jungle, led there by green dragon or approach the mountain and walk through its territory.

 Despite the size of their territories, a couple hundred square miles of swamp and jungle is more than 
 enough to house two younger black dragons. You see one flying in the air, taking in a bit of sun before 
 diving back below the canopy and out of sight. 
 You can tell you are approaching one of the dragon's lairs. The water grows more feted, the vines and 
 roots thicker. 

 ### Ettercaps  
 n-[Ettercaps](#monsterbox/Ettercap)  
 and n-[Giant Spider](#monsterbox/Giant Spider)  
 It starts with you getting slightly more annoyed at webs getting caught on your face, but several miles 
 later, with large webs bridging trees and a thin layer of webbing covering the forest floor, it is apparent 
 you are entering the territory of something. 
 The next five square miles or so are infested with ettercaps and giant spiders. A dryad appears to you, 
 stepping from behind a tree. "Please", she says, "my tree and my friends are trapped in there, hiding from 
 the beasts". The dryad is a [Green Hag](#monsterbox/Green Hag), who brought the ettercaps, but was unable 
 to control them, losing access to her lair. 
 "Please", she says again, "I can clear the webs, but I cannot handle what will come out of them. If you will 
 bargain with me, I can compensate you."

 Hag: "Wicked Mathilda Pigtooth".  
 "I have made subtle insults an art form"  
 "I will tranform into every type of hag to become something better"  
 "My daughter was taken from me and I want to find her and train her"  
     daughter - Sally Titchwillow trapped in the lair.  
 "I have an allergy to spider webs" 
 Servants: 4 [Flameskulls](#monsterbox/Flameskull)

 She has a Conjure Minor Elementals spell that she can use to summon four [Magmin](#monsterbox/Magmin). The 
 second this happens, she disappears, and the magmin sprint off into the webs.  
 HEAT: Players make DC 12 constitution checks each round. A failure incurs 1 point of fire damage. A value 
 of 6 or less incurs 1 level of exhaustion.
