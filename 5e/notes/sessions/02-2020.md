### The Sweep 
Heading north from the Kith and Kine, Iojad continues to lead the group from 
location to location. They are not too hard to identify as the terrain has 
flattened out moving away from the mountains and so prominent landmarks become 
more apparent.  
Early October, you reach the last landmark that Iojad could get information on. 
There is one additional one, but from the details of the sketch it is located 
somewhere in the Sweep. From where you are, he notes there is a small river heading 
westward toward the sweep. It is no guarantee, but he thinks maybe you could 
follow it to find the last landmark. 

As you follow the river, the trees become shorter, more weathered, and more sparse. 
Eventually Iojad lets you know you are now in the outermost parts of the sweep. 
It is a vast, flat expanse. It is distinctly colder, chilled by constant winds from 
the northeast. The soil is frozen just a couple inches under the ground, preventing 
trees from taking root, and the harh terrain is covered by lichens and hardy 
grasses painting it in colors of red, orange, and yellow. As the trees fade, the wind 
becomes a constant billowing presence. 
Iojad's hunch about the river pays off. In the relative flatness of the landscape, 
one can see for miles from even light elevation. Eventually he spots what you are 
looking for; a large dark rock stabbing upward from the landscape.  
Getting close to it, it becomes clear the rock is not natural. Despite being weathered 
by years of ice and wind, there are clear seams and layers to it, showing it was 
made by stacking large black square stones on top one another. It has a curved 
inner surface, providing shelter from the elements. Inside this, on the wall, is 
an inscription in an unknown language.
  
History DC 18 (knowledge of draconic grants advantage): The language is an ancient and 
somewhat obfuscated form of draconic. 
Perception DC 16: There are markings on the inside surface that may be part of a map. 
Investigation DC 16: The interior wall of the monument is a map indicating both 
your current location, a location roughly in the middle of the sweep, and some rough 
topographical features between here and there.

Comprehend languages reads: For pilgrims who are dead on their feet and for those with the 
weariest of bones; the Necropolis awaits. Contributions earn citizenship, just follow the 
map. Living need not apply.
