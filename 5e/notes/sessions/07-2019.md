#### Recap

The group was teleported prematurely to the Westlander's Hog, a large 
three-mast galleon captained by the evoker Anders. His ship was on 
course toward the thousand kingdoms. Arriving early, the group had a 
bit over a week to rest onboard. During this time, they helped fight 
off a pair of pirate ships who were running a blockade on the 
kingdoms ports.  
Onboard the Hog, the group met up with Izzy, who helped in the fight 
and expressed an interest in travelling with the group. 


#### Silverskein Thing
The entirety of the kingdoms is roiling with activity. Some houses 
already are in the northwest, engaging in naval skirmishes and 
raids to hamper the Empire's efforts at fortifying their northern 
frontier. Other houses are busy with preparation for war, both in 
terms of logistics, and in terms of diplomacy.  
Most of the houses of the southeatern part of the Kingdoms are 
congregating in order to have a war council. There they will be 
discussing war preparations including tactics, leadership, and 
commitment. 
Leopold's family, the Silverhammers, are one of the more 
prominent houses of that region and will be hosting some part of the 
Thing. With your wealth and claim of information regarding Leopold's 
death, you should be able to get an invitation to their estate.

#### The Silverhammers 
The Silverhammers are an old and prosperous family. They have managed 
to maintain a reasonably stable equilibrium with their neighbors; 
carefully avoiding overstepping their bounds or reach. They own a 
couple of rich Galena mines and have three towns in their demesne. 
They are renowned exporters of silver and lead goods.  
**Edison**, a robust man in his mid fifties is the head of the house. 
Leopold's sister **Galena** is the heir and has gradually taken over 
many of the duties involved with managing their lands. It is likely 
that for the war effort, Edison will deploy as a war leader, functionally 
handing off control of the house to Galena.

#### Silverskein 
The Silverhammers have control over three towns. **Plumb** is further south 
in the foothills and is home to people involved in the galena mines. 
There are also the sister towns of **North and South Ag**. South Ag is home 
to the ore processing and leadworks fed by the mines. North Ag is part 
of a trio of towns and hosts the silversmithing guild.  
The two other towns in close proximity to North Ag are **Stave**, which 
hosts a textiles guild and is under the control of the **Waulkers**, 
and **Soak**, which is under the control of the **Hallenhauses** and primarily 
functions on trade and hospitality.  
The relative stability between these houses has allowed the three towns to 
grow and exist in relative proximity to one another. All together they are 
thought of as the single city Silverskein. Between the cities, Silverskein 
has a population of around 25,000 and covers an area of around 10 square 
miles.   



#### Frostwalk
Frostwalk is a small community of around 500 people at one of the northernmost 
parts of the thousand kingdoms. There are habitated communities northwest of 
it, but they are mostly coastal and not considered part of the kingdoms' area. 
They are known for having a population of more exotic races, with around 150 
tieflings and 30 goliaths in the community. 
They are also known for having some of the only people around who can do navigation 
to the north or northeast, though that is a very niche demand. They make a fair 
amount of their money from scavenging and monster hunting both to the north and 
in the mountains. 

#### The Sweep  
North of Frostwalk is a large tundra known as The Sweep. It is in the rain shadow 
of mountains both to its south and northwest and gets very little rainfall. It is 
geographically flat and with opposing fed winds from the north and south. The 
result of this is massive winds, frequently over 60mph and sometimes over 100. 
This has given the entire region a reputation for being unnavigable as it is 
an incredibly hard trek over land, and completely hazardous by air. To add 
to this, not many people have anywhere to go up there anyways. 

At least some of the sweep is part of, or in contact a Cyric cult that protects 
a necropolis in the middle of the Sweep. The necropolis is home to some liches, 
dracoliches, and vampires that keep their own separate tombs but are near one 
another to take advantage of the geography and to occasionally confer with a 
peer.
