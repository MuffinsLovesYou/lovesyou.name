Time of Year: Early Autumn

## Recap
You left the mountain in two groups, with one group taking the safer but longer route northeast 
to connect with the east-west road connecting the empires, and the other attempting to pass 
through the blackmire in a shorter but more dangerous straight shot to Gingonol. Both routes 
involved danger, but the groups exercised caution and managed to move past their encounters.  
You all met up in the city meeting up in a inn for wealthy merchants in the inner southeast 
borough.

You all met up in town eventually and decided to have a break from the usual and put on a show 
to debut yourself to a new location. You spent a couple weeks making the preparations, and 
ended up putting on a smash success. The buzz created by the uniqueness of your approach 
ended up attracting several important people, not least of which is Kathuil himself. 

## Kathuil 
The legend of Kathuil states that he is a demigod, a bastard son of the dwarven pantheon, 
raised by clerics of Muamman Duathal, the dwarf god of wanderers, expatriates, and lightning. 
Seeing him in person is enough to make most people believers.  
He stands as tall as a human at around 5'8", but has a powerful dwarven build. His beard is 
plaited, with the individual strands dyed red, white, and brown giving the appearance of a 
cornucopia celebrating the fall harvest. He's wearing a thick suit of dark wool with decorative 
leather armor pieces like greaves, a shoulder guard and a brigandined sash.


## Missions 
Adventuring groups are less common in dwarven lands. The dwarven military rarely deals with 
mercenaries, and racial pride often makes dwarves reticent to outsource work to foreigners. 
They aren't unfamiliar with the concept though, and the embassy for the empire hosts an 
adventurer's board that is open to all.  
There is also a registry for dwarves to request help reclaiming ancestral homes or clearing 
out dangers from farmlands or mines. It is targeted more toward dwarven-based groups, but 
often reclamation requests are based on the idea of paying with recovered heirlooms, which 
professional groups often view as too dubious to accept.
