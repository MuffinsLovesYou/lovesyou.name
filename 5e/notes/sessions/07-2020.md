## Goals and stuff:

* Sentinel Shield 
* Wand of Web 
* Bag of Holding

Catalog of books. Anything interesting

#### Kit goals: 
Kit paid Gavin Caskbrow to go check up on his family. His family lives up in the Shepherd highlands.

```
    These are the instructions for Gavin Caskbrow:

    Your "quest" is to go to the highlands and check up on my brother Matthew Dunn. He lives with my da in the highlands, last I checked. I wouldn't mind hearing about da if you see him. But he's an asshole.

    They live about an hour north of Longmarsh, along the road to Pleasant Pheasant. Their oughta be an inn up that way, and I expect if you set up shop there and start telling stories or something Mathew'll show up to listen. He always liked stories.

    See, he's 25, but he's not all there. Never was. Side effect of auger root Auntie Carmine used to hold off preeclampsia. Anyway, he likes stories. Hero's and legends and all. You tell stories and he'll show up eventually if he can.

    I wanna know how he's doing. He's a good kid. And I miss him. And, like I said, da is a asshole.

    If you see Auntie Carmine, wish her well for me. If she's still alive. She's always been old. But that hasn't stopped her before. She's got the touch. Not like you and me. Different. I'll be damned if the reaper's caught up with her yet.

    Ping me on the stones when you get there. Good luck. Enjoy the road.

**Research: Multi-target sending stones** 
You can get shorter ranged telepathy via Rary's Telepathic Bond, which could be attached to a wand or staff. That being a 5th level spell, it would likely be a fairly intense item. The limitation with that spell is that everyone needs to be local for the initial cast.  



#### Sendak goals 
**Ruling request: Homunculi casting**
The Homunculus Servant cannot cast a spell from a Spell-Stored item. Like most summoned companions, it has explicit limitations on what actions it can perform.
Relevant text: Eberron 61, Homunculus Servant  
```
It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take the action in its stat block or the Dash, Disengage, Help, Hide, or Search action. 
```

**Shield Guardian**
A Shield Guardian is created very similarly to a Golem. One can obtain a manual (very rare) that expires upon creation of the construct. Creation takes 50 days and requires materials worth 60000gp.

**Notes from the warforged project** 
* What sort of people were involved 
* Who is Funda
* What was the goal of the project
