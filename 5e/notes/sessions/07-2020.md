## After the slaad fight
When the group attacked the slaad, the two death slaad nearby picked up on it and flew over. They will terminate flight when they see the group. The lead one will then cast Comprehend Languages on itself and approach to a range of 60 feet. It is not fluent in common, but knows some basic words. The other will hang back at 120 feet. Their goal is to let you know that the slaad you killed were property and to go to Pashu to discuss the matter. 

As you're leaving the cave where you slew the slaad, two humanoid figures land in the road ahead. They slowly walk toward you with some distance between them. They both have greatswords slung to them. One is walking in front with their hands up, the other is hanging back but not doing anything threatening. They approach to a distance of around 60ft and stop. The one in front says one word "leader?" If no one responds, it will begin asking telepathically.

#### Communication
Their goal is to let you know that the slaad you killed, and the gems in their heads, were the property of Jangalee Pashu and to direct you to speak with Pashu about this incident. Pashu has offices in Capital you should head to, and correspondants in the nearby port city of Lune.

#### Skill checks: 
DC 20 insight with situational advantage: These are slaad. 

#### Looks: 
Looks like a human and an elf. They are wearing fairly plain traveller's clothes and carrying nothing other than their greatswords. The one in front is a heavyset human woman, the one hanging back is a tall elf. 

#### Fight
2x[Death Slaad](#monsterbox/Death Slaad)

Tactics: 
The one in front is the more composed of the two. They are interested in capturing people alive if they can, and escaping if they must. The one in the back is angrier and is interested in doing damage.  
The front will open up by running and casting invisibility or fear and will assist with combat as long as they are in a secure position. The one in the back will maintain distance casting fireballs leading into cloudkill. 



## The capital offices of Jangalee Pashu 
The offices are clean and well put together in an upscale part of town between the university and the civic district. The building done in the imperial style with ample use of marble and bronze. It is three stories tall built compactly around a central atrium with a metallic statue of a large humanoid posing with a sword. A painting on one wall shows goblins fleeing a pack of bulettes, while on another wall is a paining of wizards casting spells from the backs of gryphons. The rooms on the lower floors are elegantly put together, enough to be able to receive a nobility if needed. The rooms on the upper floors look expensive, but utilitarian. 
The offices serve as a communication and bureaucratic hub for Pashu's operations. They are led by Emeline, a tall human female with white scales visible on her arms and neck. She takes you underground to a mostly bare room. She opens a box and removes one of several vials of translucent fluid. Uncapping it, she uses a mage hand to scrawl an invisible teleportation circle on the floor. Stepping through the portal takes the group to the Tiger's Eye. 

#### Communication 
Emeline is cold, but straightforward. She will answer any questions the group has and will assure them of their safe travel and return. She will give them the warning that they should take care to not appear threatening or insulting to Pashu and should keep their weapons sheathed and avoid casting spells.

## On board the Tiger's Eye. 
Anyone who frequents a sea-side city has a good chance of eventually seeing the Tiger's Eye. It is a large galley (around 60 meters long and 10 meters wide) that serves as a floating palace for Pashu. When in port, he hosts parties for the elite and any clients. On the seas, it is his base of operations for managing his business and his fleet. 

Stepping out of the portal, you feel that even below decks that the air is brisker here than the cool spring air you were enjoying in the capital. You are met by the illusion of a well-dressed servant. 
``` Welcome to the Tiger's Eye. If you are crew, please speak the password. Else, please wait a moment.```  
A moment passes and the illusion flickers  
``` I am a programmed illusion and cannot answer any questions, but if you will follow me, I will lead you to the meeting room. Please do not attempt to enter any other rooms or wander to other parts of the ship unless invited to.```
The servant starts guiding you down a hall with doors on one side that must run the length of the ship. It is lit by gently flickering everburning torches designed to look like thick red candles ensconsed in the walls. The wood is smooth and shows none of the expected wear for a seafaring vessel. Your footsteps fall gently on woven carpet and the smell of incense floats on the air. On the far side of the hallway on the left is an open door. The illusion guides you there and states:
``` In here please. ```
Space being at a premium on a vessel like this, this room is likely constantly repurposed to satisfy different needs. For now it is set up for a meeting, with wooden leather-backed chairs lined against the walls and a surprisingly heavy looking wood table in the middle of the room. The far wall bears a window with a view showing that the ship is anchored close to shore. Sitting between the table and the window is an older swarthy man. His thin frame is wrapped in a red, orange, and black robe with white trim. He stands to greet you as you enter and introduces himself as Jangalee Pashu. 

#### Communication  
He will confirm that the group has been briefed on and is clear about the situation. He will reiterate that he is interested in a constructive solution to the problem: 
``` 
What has been lost has been lost. As you were misled about what you were doing, I will not ask for full compensation. I will ask that you take some responsibility for your mistake, but I will do so as an opportunity both our groups can gain from. As it is, I have something that needs to be looked into. I have reports of what appears to be a hive of mysterious insect-like creatures some ways to the southeast. I have people in that region, but they do not feel equipped to get what I need.  
I need detailed information on the creatures. Whether they are truly unknown or whether they just haven't been identified. They are not native to the region, so I want to know where they come from. I want to know what their capabilities are, how smart they are, how they live, as much information as possible. I need some intact bodies of theirs that can be investigated. 
Bringing back useful information and some samples from the creatures will settle the issue with the slaads. Additionally, if you can go above and beyond that, you can stand to make some profit. Capturing three live samples can be worth a thousand each. If they have a queen or means of reproducing, capturing that can be worth up to 10k depending on their potential. If they represent a significant threat to the surrounding region, removing them as a threat can be worth up to 8k.  
```
If the group agrees, he will dispel his illusion and invite them to talk details in the planar mansion. If they refuse, he will have Sengras teleport them 


#### Fight: 
The fight will happen only if the group acts hostile. Even if they do not agree to his request, he is not interested in a fight on the ship.

Acid Trap: Upon being manually triggered, acid is sprayed from the table in the middle of the room. Everyone in the room must make a dexterity saving throw (DC 18). The acid does 4d10 acid damage, halved on a save.

## Goals and stuff:

* Helm of teleportation (possibly 2 or more) 
* Sentinel Shield -- 4 gnothic eyes
* Wand of Web  -- Giant Spider Silk
* Bag of Holding -- banderhob hide

Catalog of books. Anything interesting

#### Kit goals: 
Kit paid Gavin Caskbrow to go check up on his family. His family lives up in the Shepherd highlands.

```
    These are the instructions for Gavin Caskbrow:

    Your "quest" is to go to the highlands and check up on my brother Matthew Dunn. He lives with my da in the highlands, last I checked. I wouldn't mind hearing about da if you see him. But he's an asshole.

    They live about an hour north of Longmarsh, along the road to Pleasant Pheasant. Their oughta be an inn up that way, and I expect if you set up shop there and start telling stories or something Mathew'll show up to listen. He always liked stories.

    See, he's 25, but he's not all there. Never was. Side effect of auger root Auntie Carmine used to hold off preeclampsia. Anyway, he likes stories. Hero's and legends and all. You tell stories and he'll show up eventually if he can.

    I wanna know how he's doing. He's a good kid. And I miss him. And, like I said, da is a asshole.

    If you see Auntie Carmine, wish her well for me. If she's still alive. She's always been old. But that hasn't stopped her before. She's got the touch. Not like you and me. Different. I'll be damned if the reaper's caught up with her yet.

    Ping me on the stones when you get there. Good luck. Enjoy the road.

    Kit

**Research: Multi-target sending stones** 
You can get shorter ranged telepathy via Rary's Telepathic Bond, which could be attached to a wand or staff. That being a 5th level spell, it would likely be a fairly intense item. The limitation with that spell is that everyone needs to be local for the initial cast.  



#### Sendak goals 
**Ruling request: Homunculi casting**
The Homunculus Servant cannot cast a spell from a Spell-Stored item. Like most summoned companions, it has explicit limitations on what actions it can perform.
Relevant text: Eberron 61, Homunculus Servant  
```
It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take the action in its stat block or the Dash, Disengage, Help, Hide, or Search action. 
```

**Shield Guardian**
A Shield Guardian is created very similarly to a Golem. One can obtain a manual (very rare) that expires upon creation of the construct. Creation takes 50 days and requires materials worth 60000gp.

* Who is Funda
* What was the goal of the project
