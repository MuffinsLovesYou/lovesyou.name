## Recap: 
The group was summoned to Egath Meden, a village of tribal jungle dwarves. There, they met 
with Venerable Eberk, who grew up with Kathuil and is something like a sister to him. She said 
she has two jobs for you. The first and most pressing job, was to protect the village against 
a gnoll warband.  
The village prepared to move while the group prepared to confront the gnolls at an intercept 
point. Though the gnolls had numbers, the group outclassed them in experience and equipment. With 
that threat taken care of, it is now time to hear about Eberk's request.

It is October and the first of the wet season storms have started to come through, though it is 
still a bit too early for a typhoon, for now it is just lazy storms with warm fat drops of rain 
that spend themselves in a couple of hours.  
This time of year sees the most people leaving the city. The large seafaring ships are mostly 
packed up and in the process of making their final departures, emptying out the southeast of 
the city outide the walls. Many locals will also take this time to visit mountain homes or 
further places if they have the money. 
Many dwarves in town working as part of their term of service are also transferred during this time 
as the weather prevents working outdoors for anyone but specialists. Guards and soldiers are moved 
to other posts or field training elsewhere. The army of priests and artisans that maintain the city's 
foundations and infrastructure are put on leave. If a skilled artisan is working on a masterpiece they 
will often hole up in the city for this time, but otherwise it is common for them to visit another 
city to try and pick up a lucrative commission. 


### Eberk's Vault
Eberk needs a week in the city to prepare and to see people since she's been out for a while. She 
takes Flaggfur with her. 

Eberk has her travelling gear and some wealth stored in town. She can compensate the group for 
their efforts at saving her group and discuss the work she is interested in having them do. 

### Havlan  
Havlan, in disguise, contacts the group. 
* If he was not doing anything in particular, we will say he contacted Kit weeks ago during the gala. 
In this case, Kit gets the option of 'prep time' to prepare against the enemy. 
* If Kit was busy, Havlan contacts the group now. 

Havlan brings bad news. Leopold was executed which has severely damaged relations between the empire 
and the thousand kingdoms and may lead to some conflict. Sif is alive and has been fanning the flames 
and spreading misinformation in order to cover for herself. Havlan has been laying low, but as soon 
as he heard that the group had shown up in Ging Onol he started a forced march across the continent.  


The group isn't officially wanted, but 
a substantial price has been put on their heads.  
Several weeks ago, the group killed the protegee of an assassin known as the flayer. The Flayer has 
recruited help from a rogue adventuring group known as The Filth. 


## The Flayer and The Filth.  
There's a 300 gold bounty on the head of every member of the group who was active during the 
group's time in the capital. It isn't public and as such is only spreading by word of mouth, but 
it is enough money to gain the interest of some fairly dangerous groups.  


* [The Flayer](#monsterbox/the flayer)
* [Filthy Luke](#monsterbox/the filth/filthy luke)
* [Fats Nasty](#monsterbox/the filth/fats nasty)
* [Jenny Rotten](#monsterbox/the filth/jenny rotten)
* [Rat King](#monsterbox/the filth/rat king)

#### General approach: 
They are cautious by nature. They do not know how strong you are but they do know you are dangrous. They 
will prefer to harry and skirmish if possible to gather intelligence. 
They are willing to attack in the city, but only with planning. 

Tricks:
They want to kill this group. They do not know who they are but have descriptions. 

Gather intel: 

If the group moves at night, Astra will snipe at them and flee. 


* Glyph of warding on room door.
* Stealing others' image 


#### Battle tactics: 
The flayer is only comfortable fighting at night, at which point she likes to get closer. During the day, 
she fights only if she has to and prefers doing so from range with her longbow. 

In general, the Filth prefers picking opponents off from range. They like disabling and drawing in enemies and 
either fleeing to harass them further later, or sending in Fats for the kill. 

Luke plays support in combat. He will cast Greater Invisibility on Fats to let her wreak havoc. After that 
he likes casting stinking cloud on ranged. For melee he likes heat metal or hold person.

Fats only fights when they are committed to the kill. She grabs and throws as she charges. In melee, she 
focuses on one opponent, grabbing and shoving them prone before beating them. 

Jenny focuses on slowing and weakening melee attackers to soften them up and draw them in. In a committed fight 
she will slow all enemies. She is defensive minded and maintains armor of agathys as much as possible. 

Rat King is does support by disabling or distracting the enemy. He uses his illusory double early to distract 
opponents. He will cast sanctuary on Luke if he is targeted or on Jenny if she is targeted by range and will 
often delay initiative to nail the timing. 
In a committed fight, he blinks, mirror images, and often spirit guardians himself to run amongst the enemy 
causing chaos and dealing damage.
