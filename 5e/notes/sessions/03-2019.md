## New adventure arc soon!

#### Recap 
The group has cleared out Bloodkith halls and has returned to Singedbrow. Jack has been 
unpetrified. Eberk has presented the deed. If the group wants to begin the recovery process 
on the halls, they can discuss it with artisans here. 

## The Hammer and the Communion  
The group has presented the Hammer of the Covenant to Eberk as agreed. 

Her goal: To get Flaggfur to enact the communion ritual. Her hope is that this will reveal 
the truth of Kathuil's possible divinity and hopefully provide direction or peace of mind 
to a troubled Katuil. 
Her fear: That Kathuil will engage in self-destructive behavior given his conflicted feelings 
about godhood. Or that he is being menipulated. 

It is easy enough to secure a room in Singedbrow to perform the ritual. She assists with the 
attunement of the hammer and the steps to the ritual itself. When the ritual is finished, 
a form apparates in the room.  
The form is that of a male dwarf. He stands tall at around five feet high. His outfit is 
well made yet austere with a yellow tunic, leather breeches, and a dark orange wool coat. He 
has a sword on one hip, a set of weights and scales on the other, a fine lute hangs on his back 
and a jeweller's eyepiece from his neck. His orange beard is well groomed but not fussy.  
He is the dwarf god Vergadain; god of wealth and luck. He was one of the gods that sided with 
Marthammor against Moradin after the rescuing of Kathuil. A master of song, poetry, trade, and 
negotiation, he appears before you seemingly pleased to see you. 

His long term goal: To make his faith mainstream by highlighting his virtues over the more 
traditional dwarven ones. 
His fear: That dwarves will continue to tend toward stagnation and hierarchy.

His immediate goal: To entice Flaggfur to become his champion. 
His immediate fear: To be seen as a villain. 

#### Vergadain's work ethic and the spirit of capitalism  
Vergadain has been impressed by Flaggfur and wishes to have him as a champion. 

His appeal:  
Dwarves have a tendency toward stagnation, getting bogged down in hierarchy and fitting 
into the small physical and social spaces allowed to them. This helped them survive 
underground for so long, but is also what almost destroyed them. Kathuil helped bring 
them above ground where they can make more of themselves, but still I see them falling 
into the old habits. They forego improving themselves, instead satisfying themselves 
filling the same small niches in service to others and whiling away their free time and 
money on drink and frivolty.
Though larger than some would guess, my church is still small; my followers are still 
shy about proclaiming who they follow. This is a sign of stagnation because my values 
run contrary to the traditional values that limit dwarves. 


What one of my followers values is the **improvement** of their self and the world around them; 
to expand not as far as the enclosing walls, but as far as their abilities allow. Wealth 
is both the measure of and the means to enact this improvement. It is the better dwarf 
that succeeds in their ventures, and you can see their quality in the reflections of 
that succcess. It is the successful dwarf who is most poised to enact positive change 
on the world around them for they have the means to enact change not just with their 
own hands, but with the best tools and assistance.  
What one of my followers values is **modesty**. It is the new dwarf, blinded by the light 
of the surface, who seeks the appearance of success and wastes their money on opulence 
and profligation. To them I say that since they do not use their money to improve, their 
success is an illusion. Because it is an illusion, it will either fade away or they will 
fall to seeking ill gotten gains to sustain it. 
What one of my followers values is **industry**. It is the old dwarf, hunched in their 
cave, who only works as much as needed to fill their role and whiles away their spare 
time on drink and sport. To them I say they are ensuring they will always be small for 
they limit their potential to fit their mold. Improvement and wealth grow and inspire 
more improvement and wealth. 






His appeal: 

Tenets of Vergadain:  
* Improvement: To improve both oneself and the world around you is the definition of virtue. 
* Means: Wealth is the simplest way to measure and enact that improvement. 
    * Self improvement yields prosperity. It is the better dwarf that succeeds in their ventures. 
    And as such, that dwarf's wealth becomes a measurement of how much they have improved. 
    * Your prosperity extends naturally to the world around you. 
* Modesty and Dedication:
