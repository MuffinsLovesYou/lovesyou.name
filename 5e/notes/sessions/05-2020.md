## Done with the last arc


## News: 
The group has been out in the world for about 8 months. 

Lady Sif's estates were sacked by an unexpected force from the Thousand Kingdoms. Lots of high value horses were stolen, and the fields and buildings were razed. Lady Sif was not on the estates at the time. The marauders did not linger and were unable to be engaged on land or sea.  
An attack so deep in the empire against such a prominent person has shaken confidence for many. Vassal kingdoms accross the empire have withdrawn from some commitments in order to secure their own lands. Most are being careful not withdraw too much or to be seen as seceding, though some are being more aggressive causing a cascade of friction between neighboring states. 

Shortly after the attack on her estates, and while she was away to deal with that, Lady Sif's palace in the capital was raided by an unknown group. What they were after is not known, but since then, Lady Sif has not been seen. Adding to the scandal, Lord Senedeth has vacated his palace and not been seen since either. 

The goblinoid event up north is not going well. Historically speaking, it isn't going worse than many events in the past, but that is far worse than expectations. The empire's goal was to have 16 forts staggered accross the narrowest landmass to harry and disrupt the goblins at their most vulnerable point. Beyond that, several mobile and well provisioned armies were to be set up to engage with the weakened and diminished goblin horde, minimizing fallthrough to the mountain dwarves or to populated lands beyond.  
The three-part war against the Elk Tribes, the Horde, and the Thousand Kingdoms has damaged the plan significantly. Of the 16 planned forts, only 12 got built, and of those, 8 have fallen. Supply line harassment and some forces being recalled by their respective vassal states have likewise diminished the fallthrough armies.  
Adjustments are being made to manage the situation. The fallthrough forces have been repositioned and the mountain dwarves are prepared to contribute. It is expected that the event is past its zenith, but is still projected to last 4-6 more months. 

Kathuil has been absent from Ging Onol. 
Him, Krismorel Bearcharger, Lam Dur, and Bastion Byrne have set out to the underdark. They're going to smash one of the great altars to Lolth just to be epic and shit. 





## Random Notes: 

Scaled up teleportation circles: Similar to the underdark exile ritual, there are rituals to 
perform scaled up teleportations. Normal teleportation circle is 1 round duration, good for moving 
about 12 people in a 3x4 column at a time. Using scaled up ritualized casting, a longer duration 
portal can be opened up to comfortably move more people. 

Cost to move a person via teleportation circle: ~4gp for materials, but the mage must be paid. 
Cost to purchase a casting of a spell: 
    Broad strokes: about half of the cost of a scroll of the same spell, or about 1/4 the cost of a magic item of the given rarity. Spells that would be expected to be in regular high-demand are more likely to have their prices driven down. So healing/curing, light divination, and teleportation spells will often have dedicated practitioners who can offer them more cheaply. 
A purchase of teleportation circle would end up closer to 1000gp, but in reality is likely to be closer to 500-600.


Cost to create a permanent teleportation circle: 50gp/day for a year. so 18250gp.

Ritualized scaling up of spells: 
Generally we can assume there is a world of magic above and beyond what's in the spell book. The spell books most likely represent incredibly well-established magics that are castable by a single person in the field.  
Experimental magics, group magics, and extended ritual magics are probably a wider field. We can expect a variety of spells out there that aren't suitable for adventuring due to taking too long to cast, requiring external sources of energy, requiring multiple casters, or whatever, but that offer more versatility over the PHB spells.  
So lets say that there is likely to be improvements over teleportation circle available, like ones that last longer so more people can file through, or ones that can connect to a more temporary and less-established link.
