## Recap  
Rayne, assisted by a group of clerics performing an experimental ritual, managed to 
change her warlock patron by garnering the interest of the archangel [angel] and by 
suppressing her connection to Asmodeus.  
The group enjoyed some of the harvest festivals that happen at the end of summer in 
preparation for the wet season to come. They partook in both the common festivals 
that run throughout the city, but were also invited to an exclusive event where 
some of the wealthiest and most powerful dwarves gathered at a luxurious theater to 
engage in artistic and athletic competition.  
The group paid for the opportunity to have Flagfor challenge none other than Kathuil 
himself to a competition of boast and oratory. When it came time for his rebuttal, 
Flagfor flipped the script and sang praises to Kathuil in a way that rang loud and 
true and were well received. 

Switching a pact is a dangerous business:

An out of town dwarf who introduced himself as Kildrak ended up being another infernal 
warlock. He subtly charmed the group and led them to an isolated area where he attacked 
along with some hired muscle and an odd wood elf. A small group of modrons, beings 
of pure lawfulness, also appeared. Lastly, an erinyes, personally responsible for 
Rayne's contract and soul, emerged. The group scrapped their way through the battle.


## Eberk's Request  
The group is visited by a couple of dwarves. One wears the livery and stone faced 
expression of a palace servant. The other is considerably more wild looking.  
The one in livery performs a formal introduction. The savage looking dwarf is named 
[Rorick Egathan](#monsterbox/jaguar warrior). He sports braided and dreaded hair 
and beard down to his bare knees. He wears a beaten breastplate over a bare chest and 
breeches made of leopard hide. His exposed skin is covered in thick hair and scars. 
He carries a shield with severa javelins strapped to it and a strange weapon like a 
sword made from two wooden planks bound together to hold in place a cutting edge of 
sharpened stones, shards of metal, and the teeth and claws of various beasts.  
Rorick bears an invitation that has been verified to be from Venerable Eberk and is 
prepared to act as a guide if you accept the invitation. 

[Venerable Eberk](#monsterbox/eberk)
is not commonly known, but she is the closest thing to a family that 
Kathuil has. According to legend, when Kathuil was cast out from Mount Celestia by 
Moradin, he was rescued by Muamman Duathal, the dwarven god of travellers and expatriates 
(oh, and lightning). Kathuil was entrusted to Eberk's master Fonn Searbh by Muamman when 
Eberk was barely an apprentice. That Eberk is still alive is something known to very few. 
She is currently a village elder at Egath Meden, a village hidden deep in the jungle 
several days' travell upriver from Gingonol.

### Egath Meden 
Egath Meden is a tribe of the little-known jungle dwarves. They are highly secretive and 
isolationist, living deep in the wildest forests and avoiding contact with the outside 
world. They worship Thard Harr, the dwarven god of survival and hunting and patron of 
wild dwarves. Eberk was accepted despite being an outsider because of her wisdom, and 
because of the friendly relationship between Thard Harr and Muamman Duathal. 

Eberk is about as old as a dwarf can get. Barely older than Kathuil, she is well into her 
third century of life. She has a request of you. From Gingonol, she had Rorick fetch 
some possessions of her including her lineage and rights to an unclaimed mountain home. 
Though she abandoned her clan name when she became a priest of Muamman, she has rights 
to reclaim the home, and has decided to undertake that as probably the last project 
of her life.  

### Proving yourselves 
A war band of albino gnolls, calling themselves the Abyssal Mutilators is approaching Egath Meden. 
Some of their forerunners were intercepted and one was captured. The dwarves have 
been discussing whether to run or fight. From scrying them, the war band appears to have 50 members 
including their hyenas. They are slowed down by periodic infighting but would likely overtake the 
dwarven village if they caught wind of the dwarves. 

Band Distribution: 
The gnoll warband is split into three groups.
