## On Nelalwe's estate  
Working off of a map found on the inner surface of the last dream landmark, the group 
traversed the sweep and found the Necropolis. On its outskirts, they found an abandoned 
labratory with petrified crafters and researchers. Helping to depetrify them, they found 
that this was a team brought together unbeknownst to them by the archlich "Funda" to 
work on a project of imbuing life and free will into constructs of wood and steel.  

One of the researchers was an errant druid, formerly a leader of the Claw Mountain conclave. 
The part of Erin that had been drawn to the mountain since freeing it of its curse could not 
resist the call to return there with this druid to attempt to rebuild.
