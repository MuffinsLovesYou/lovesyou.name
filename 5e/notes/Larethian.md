## Larethian  

The splendor of the empire's capital, with its high walls, wide roads, feats of architecture, and endless 
sea of citizens is enough to awe any visitor, but with time anyone can become to accustomed to the sights. 
On first sight you are not sure you could ever get used to the sun elf city of Larethian. 
The Ivory Tower university boasts a tower over four hundred feet high, but Larethian has hundreds of trees 
grown together that form an almost opaque canopy just over three hundred feet high. Lone trees have trunks 
that are vertical cylindars with thirty and forty foot diameters. In some places, three trees will have 
been grown twisting around each other in a spiral. Bridges span between the trees in irregular patterns 
all the way up. Lower down, workshops, kitchens and meeting areas are carved through the bases of the 
redwoods, while higher up, smaller doorways indicate individual and family domiciles. 
You see this over the walls, thirty feet of impenetrably thick interwoven vines and stones. Few guards 
line the walls; if the city were under siege thousands of longbows could fire from the taller trees inside.
Living trees the size of houses, their bodies wrapped in armor of densely woven vines and wielding tree-trunk 
lances patrol the perimiter with untiring vigilance. 
The walls encompass an area a little over a mile in diameter, housing tens of thousands. Outside the city are 
miles of satellite towns, communities of specialists, temples, and homes of long lived families. A venerable 
elf can live ten times as long as a human and here in the middle of the forest they spend their lives studying 
perfection of themselves and their environment. You pass sculptors meditating in front of their work, engaging 
in rituals of mental and emotional preparation to make the next alteration in a process that can last over a 
decade. Occasionally sweet notes drift over, coming from the song of a master bard singing a song of growth 
to the ancient wood of someone's home. Laying on a bench, some manner of spellcaster lazily spins colored 
prestidigital lights at her fingertips. Clerics in white cloth visit and provide assistance. Other clerics 
sit in a circle around two sparring combatants, one with a baton wielded like a longsword and producing small 
bursts of flame from their off-hand, the other pushing and parrying with a large shield waiting for an opening 
to strike with the open palm of their other hand. 

### Population and Elders  

Elvish society is based on nuance learned over what would be multiple lifetimes of another race. Any two elves 
will have a web of relationships and understandings between them even if they have never met. There is little 
room for pride and most elves will prefer to yield to another that has precedence in a situation than to work 
against them. This can make dealing with the elves difficult as they seem anarchic to an outsider. Elves who 
spend most of their lives insulated deep in the woods will have difficulty communicating with outsiders.

A city of this size has non-elves though. Like most races, the elves find halflings delightful, and the city 
possesses one of the largest single populations of that diminutive race. There are very few dwarves and gnomes. 
While those races can happily interact with elves in more mixed settings, elves from the deep woods or dwarves 
from the deep mountains will have trouble finding common ground with one another. There are few representatives 
of the empire, but those that you see are magnificent. A hammer lord in gilded plate, with a plaited beard 
of alternating red and purple dyed strands strides beside a lean half-orc female who moves like a dancer in 
purple laquered half plate. The intent is clear. The empire has sent some of its best representatives to leave 
a minimal but potent presence in the city. An effort to avoid fostering bitterness but still providing a reminder 
that though this city was never touched by the war, it lies in conquered lands. 

For settling the rare dispute, or for speaking on behalf of large amounts of elves, there are Elders. An Elder 
is an elf of both great age and power, who, no matter what the situation is, stands in such relation to the 
elves around them that their precedence is undisputed.
