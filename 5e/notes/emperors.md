## Hacen 5 years

The current emperor in his tenth year as such. Hacen is most actively engaged in securing 
the empire's borders. When not in one of the major cities dealing with his political obligations, 
he moves between suppressing rebellions and overseeing the construction of a massive fortification 
along the northern borders. He is a 55 year old human and a decorated general. 

## Frederick 80years

Frederick served as emperor for eighty years before stepping down. As a half-elf, he seemed 
an unlikely choice, but proved himself to be a master diplomat, overseeing negotiations that 
ended the Elf War. His other great achievement was the moving of the capital from the mountain 
Citadel of Shepherd, to The Ivory Tower in Mana.  

## Chaotan  25 years

Chaotan caused a large stir when she was appointed. She was young for the role, not yet out of 
her twenties. She was born and raised by nomadic tribespeople that had been warring with the 
empire for decades. She also had almost no apparent knowledge of or interest in imperial culture.  
That she was not active in any apects of civic governance came as a relief to many. Her contributions 
were almost entirely martial, but in that regard she was incredibly effective. During her twenty 
five year reign, she helped redefine the tactical doctrine of both the dwarven and non dwarven 
militaries toward what it is today. She also aggressively escalated the war against the elves, 
gaining unprecedented ground against them and laying the foundation for their surrender. She 
is both lionized and demonized in her legacy.
