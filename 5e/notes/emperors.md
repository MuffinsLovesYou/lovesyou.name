[worldtimeline](#notes/timeline)

### Markus -65bf - -32bf
Recognized as the first emperor, though he would be better described as a warlord since the 
empire had not been formed yet. He was a member of the Shepherd warrior caste. Shepherd had 
been growing and profiting off its military, bringing the otherwise poor landlocked country 
into the political landscape.  
Its new-wealth merchant caste ordered a military campaign to try and capture some of the 
crescent in order to gain access to the sea to further grow the landlocked nation. Markus 
was of a conservative mindset that did not regard the changing power dynamics and 
led a coup to subjugate the merchant class before continuing a broader campaign of conquest.

### Tychus -32bf - 70f
Childless, Markus named Tychus, one of his generals, as his successor. Tychus continued the 
expansionist campaign by fighting against the Gar steppe riders on the other side of the Gate, 
and against Shatterplate to the north, their most noteworthy military rival.  
He penned the tenets of the Joined States empire, which included the rights of vassal states, 
and the new model of succession, both of which were intended to try and help with internal 
stability while the empire was growing. 
He negotiated peace with the Gar, though they remained unconquered, but did get the surrender 
of most of Shatterplate by securing help from the New Dwarves. He and Kathuil signed an 
alliance between the Joined States and the new Dwarves. Part of this alliance was the planning 
of a war to conquer the elven forests to unify the two empires and settle old and deep grudges 
between the dwarves and elves. Tychus, feeling he was too old to effectively oversee this, 
stepped down.

### Changa Yarya 33f - 90f
Changa, a Gar warlord, succeeded Tychus as the first aspirant to become empress. She has the 
most mixed legacy of any emperor. She came from a unconquered people who has recently been 
hostile to the empire. She favored breaking the enemy's will to fight through brutality over 
victory through siege and logistics. She was also nearly absent as a political leader, and 
nearly broke the nation through how much wealth and lives were spent on the war.  
She stepped down after breaking through the northern and eastern forests where the elves had 
put up their strongest defense. 

### Blaedywick 90f-176f
With the elves in retreat, and the joined states near collapse, Blaedywick focused heavily on 
infrastructure and trade. The first non-human empress, she utilized people's general perception 
of gnomes as useful, friendly neighbors to help calm and reassure people who were weary of 
violence.  
At home, she focused on infrastructure and security. She ordered construction of high quality 
roads to connect large cities and trade routes. She began projects to improve sanitation in 
some of the capitals of vassal states. She also initiated the adventurering system to try and 
utilize a growing population of retiring veterans to help with local security issues.  
For the war, she connected the empire via a east-west road that bifurcated the elven forests. 
The road allowed for more securing of the northern forests and deeper strikes into the southern 
forests. It also allowed her empire to take on a engineering, support, and fortification role 
to assist the increasingly militarized dwarves. 

## Frederick 176f-235f 
The half-elf Frederick is a master diplomat. He took the increasing prosperity brought on by 
Blaedywick's work and turned it into massive political capital. The biggest feather in his cap 
was ending the elf war. Aside from that, he announced the Ivory Tower as the new capital of the imperium, and 
began its construction. 

## Hacen 235f-now (240f)
Hacen is a middle aged human. A retired commodore of a merchant guild, his focus so far has been 
largely on securing the northern border against the next goblinoid invasion. He has also 
ordered the expansion of the imperial naval capacity.
