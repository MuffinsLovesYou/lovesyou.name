# lovesyou.name
This is my personal website for fooling around.  The .name domain is a bit wonky, but it is cheap and I'm not trying to draw traffic here so no biggie.  It is mostly for me experimenting and playing with web technologies, as well as occasionally creating small apps/pages for my use.  

## the theme
When I first created the website I wanted a clean theme that was largely image based, as I wasn't going to be loading the thing down with content. I got the 'phantom' theme from https://html5up.net/phantom and retooled it a bit.  Recently I did a ground-up rewrite, keeping the same general concepts, but stripping it down so heavily there's not much of the original theme left.
